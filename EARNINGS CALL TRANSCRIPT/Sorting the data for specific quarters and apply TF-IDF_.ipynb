[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker for today, Jessica Baehr, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\\nJessica Baehr -- Head of Investor Relations\\nThank you. Good morning, and welcome to Equitable Holdings first quarter 2020 earnings call. Materials for today's call can be found on our website at ir.equitableholdings.com.\\nBefore we begin, I would like to note that some of the information we present today is forward-looking and subject to certain SEC rules and regulations regarding disclosure. Our results may materially differ from those expressed in or indicated by such forward-looking statements. So I'd like to point out the Safe Harbor language on Slide 2 of our presentation. You can also find our Safe Harbor language in our 10-Q.\\nJoining me on today's call is Mark Pearson, President and Chief Executive Officer of Equitable Holdings; Anders Malmstrom, our Chief Financial Officer; and Nick Lane, President of Equitable Life. Also on the line is John Weisenseel, AllianceBernstein's Chief Financial Officer.\\nDuring this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures that are not based on generally accepted accounting principles, also known as non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and related definitions may be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website, in our earnings release, slide presentation and financial supplement.\\nI would now like to turn the call over to Mark, Anders and Nick for their prepared remarks.\\nMark Pearson -- Chief Executive Officer and President\\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. It's obviously a difficult time for most people. So first and most importantly, I hope that you and your families are all safe and well.\\nWe're going to try and do three things today. I'm going to give an overview, then Anders will take you through our balance sheet and results; and lastly, Nick will give an update on what we're seeing in April and talk about the robustness of our business model.\\nSo now turning to Slide 3. During this terrible pandemic and its tremendous human and economic challenges, Equitable has a special role to play. It is times like this that we, Equitable, show our role in society.\\nOur purpose is to protect families and secure the financial well-being of our clients, so they can live long and fulfilling lives. And I'm so proud of the ingenuity and commitment of our people in delivering exactly this. 98% of the Equitable workforce is working remotely today. And of course, we are supporting our people with a comprehensive stay well program. They've done a remarkable job at accelerating our digital outreach, launching new planning tools and keeping the highest levels of service and advice to our clients.\\nWe recognize also that we are part of a wider community and that many in society need an extra hand now. Through the Equitable Foundation, we have been providing financial support, particularly geared toward feeding and educating children.\\nToday, we'll talk about earnings for the first quarter, but it's most important now that we cover the strength of our balance sheet and how our business model will fare in these volatile times. Equitable has a resilient balance sheet. Our RBC ratio is approximately 450% to 475%. We have over $1 billion of liquidity at Equitable Holdings and nearly $7 billion at Equitable Life. Our strong position today is the result of a decade-long risk management program. This includes strategies to remove basis risk exposure, pioneering volatility management tools and introducing new categories for products like buffered annuities.\\nAnd at all times, we've maintained a high-quality fixed income portfolio with strong emphasis on diversification. Most importantly, we hedge to our full economic liabilities. This means that we immunize our balance sheet to interest rates. We managed to  l ratios are healthy.\\nAnd secondly, and obviously, we've got off with [Phonetic] somewhat normal economic conditions. And for the past several weeks and certainly back in March time, it certainly wasn't normal conditions, but markets have slowly come back, we've adapted.\\nAnd under current conditions, we should be able to meet our target for 2020 on the payout ratio.\\nSuneet Kamath -- Citi -- Analyst\\nRight. I'm just trying to get a sense of is that -- if we do go back to March 31 equity market levels, how much of an impact could that have on that payout ratio?\\nMark Pearson -- Chief Executive Officer and President\\nI think the only thing we can give you is that sensitivity what we said to earnings, and that is if markets are down 10% for a full year, that would hit earnings by $150 million.\\nYou can make your own assumptions from that.\\nSuneet Kamath -- Citi -- Analyst\\nOkay. And then the second question was on the AB stake. I think, Anders, earlier in the year, you talked about a review of the stake and getting back to investors at some point in 2020. Is that still under way?\\nAnd just curious if the impact of COVID and all the uncertainty that's causing is going to change the timing of any announcement that you guys might make on that?\\nMark Pearson -- Chief Executive Officer and President\\nSuneet, yeah, your memory is correct. We did indeed say that. But as you indicated in your question, I mean, quarter ONE has been really focused on maintaining the strength of the balance sheet; secondly, supporting our people and our clients.\\nAnd then, as Nick outlined, adapting the business model. So I think, as we said before on AB, look, we're comfortable with the 65%. It's our norm. We will get to look at it. But you're right, we haven't done anything in this quarter ONE, it's certainly not our priority.\\nSuneet Kamath -- Citi -- Analyst\\nOkay. Got it. Thank you.\\nMark Pearson -- Chief Executive Officer and President\\nThanks.\\nOperator\\nRyan Krueger with KBW, your line is open.\\nRyan Krueger -- Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods -- Analyst\\nHi. Good morning. Anders, you mentioned that you're advocating for the NAIC to change the mean reversion interest rate assumptions under STAT. I guess, can you just give us any update on if you think there's a chance that, that would happen and that they do kind of change the current methodology?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah, I would love to do so, Ryan. Good morning. But then I think this is outside of my range to predict and what regulators are doing.\\nBut look, again, I think what we just advocate here making sure that we appropriately evaluate our liabilities and make sure that on both sides of the balance sheet we have a fair value approach. I think that's the only way we have a fair representation of our liabilities, and we can actually manage our liabilities and going forward. And that's really what we're advocating for, is it under STAT? Is it under GAAP? And that's why we use our economic model, which is a full fair value model.\\nBut I cannot predict what the regulators are doing, I can just advocate in one direction.\\nRyan Krueger -- Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods -- Analyst\\nGot it. And then on the $100 million to $130 million potential COVID claims for 100,000 deaths, it seems kind of high. I guess, is that because you have a higher market share in the New York Metro Area and you adjusted the estimate to account for that?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nNo. What we did, Ryan, is really we just took the current data that we see coming out of this end of April. So -- and we just try to link that back to our portfolio. It is very hard right now to do that because there's many factors that have to go in here. It's the age. It's the region. It's the social environment people live in.\\nSo that's why we give this range. I feel confident with the range, but I -- look, I tell you, this is a lot of uncertainty here that's why we gave you that range.\\nRyan Krueger -- Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods -- Analyst\\nThank you.\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions]\\nAlex Scott with Goldman Sachs, your line is open.\\nAle ds. This measure, which considers our credit risk, impacts the calculation of the estimated fair value of liabilities.\\nFor additional context, should credit spreads narrow, we would expect the opposite impact. To reiterate, this impact during the quarter helped to illustrate precisely why we believe operating earnings is the best proxy for analyzing our performance. As equities sharply declined and interest rates fell in the first quarter, our adjustment was positive, in line with our expectations and previously communicated guidance.\\nFinally, other adjustments to net income this quarter primarily include impacts related to the realignment of GAAP interest rate assumptions in our Protection Solutions and Group Retirement segments and taxes. I would now like to highlight our capital and liquidity position outlined on Slide 8.\\nAs Mark mentioned earlier, the challenging economic environment this quarter has truly allowed us to demonstrate the strength and resiliency of our balance sheet. Last quarter, we announced our new minimum capitalization target of 375% to 400% RBC.\\nThis quarter, despite the S&P falling 20% and U.S. Treasury rates reaching historic lows, we closed the quarter with an RBC ratio of 450% to 475%, continuing to remain well in excess of our minimum target, including CTE98 for VAs. Our hedging target is the economic liability, which assumes the forward curve for interest rates compared to the statutory framework, which relies on a 3.5% reversion to mean assumption. Because we are fully hedged on interest rates, we are overhedged on a statutory basis. This does not imply that we have more excess capital, rather, the increase in assets match the movements in our economic liabilities.\\nAs a result, the interest rate hedge gains protected our RBC during this highly volatile quarter. In terms of liquidity, our well-diversified sources helped to further fortify our balance sheet. As of the end of the first quarter, cash and liquid assets were approximately $1 billion at the holding company, above our $500 million minimum target.\\nAt our insurance company, cash and liquid assets are nearly $7 billion as a result of hedging to our economic liabilities. This is not distributable capital as it is backing our economic liabilities. Between ongoing quarterly distributions from AllianceBernstein and the annual Life company dividend, we anticipate midyear, we are well positioned to continue generating strong cash flows from our operating entities.\\nOur strong position is further enhanced by the additional liquidity levers we already have in place, including $4.4 billion of credit lines and $1 billion in contingent capital through P-Caps. In the first quarter, we returned $274 million to shareholders, including $69 million to quarterly cash dividend and $205 million of share buyback.\\nIn addition, we intend to increase our quarterly dividend by $0.02 to $0.17 per share payable in the second quarter. As a result of our financial strength and cash flow generation, our capital management program remains on target. Furthermore, if equity markets are sustained at current levels through year-end, we expect to continue to deliver on the 50% to 60% target payout ratio.\\nMoving to our investment portfolio on Page 9. I want to continue to illustrate how our risk management framework has placed us in a strong position to withstand a wide range of adverse and severe credit scenario, while still maintaining a robust capital position. We take a conservative approach to managing our general account, actively managing risk and investing in a diversified mix of high-quality assets.\\nAs of quarter end, over 70% of our portfolio was invested in corporates and treasuries and 98% of our fixed maturities were investment-grade with an average portfolio rating of A2. Our corporate bond portfolio has an average credit rating of A3 and is well diversified across geography and industry, leaving us with a limited exposure to challenged sectors such as energy and transportation.\\nOur commercial mortgage loans are characterized by high-quality collaterals loc x Scott -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\\nHi. Good morning. My question is just on the liquidity position in the operating company. I mean, it sounds like that went up pretty substantially. So I was just interested if you could talk about that and if it's related at all to reallocation, if there's a -- if we should expect sort of a drag on the yield you are earning or if it's kind of incremental assets related to the hedge program, if there's some extra income that will be produced there? Just help us think about that liquidity position and how it will affect things?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes, good morning, Alex. And yes, right, absolutely, since we have the hedging program in place, we had a lot of inflows in March. And so this additional liquidity is really coming from the hedging program. So it's additional liquidity. It's really from the cash settlement of the derivatives.\\nAnd we want to keep that flexibility right now because there's still a lot of uncertainty. That's why we have a much higher cash position than usually. So it is incremental. It's not because we liquidated assets.\\nAlex Scott -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\\nGot it. So no go-forward drag from that?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nRight.\\nAlex Scott -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\\nOkay. And then next question I had is just when I think about loss recognition in Protection and the comments that were made around just increased volatility, which I understand, will that sort of change the way that the COVID-19 impact your financial statement? And what I mean by that is you gave your range in terms of, like, what the incremental claims could be, but is there anything about being in loss recognition and that volatility that occurs from that, that could cause the swings related to the COVID-19 claims to kind of come through in an abnormal way?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah. So as we said, I mean, we have went back into loss recognition. It's really driven by the interest rate assumption change. So that's the main driver going forward. So that's what's going to create volatility in the future.\\nJust to remind you now, this volatility will go away under LDTI, the loss recognition framework will change, and we won't be in that framework anymore. But look, it's volatility and volatility is going to be impacted by many things. Mortality is just one of them, but I wouldn't see that as the biggest driver.\\nAlex Scott -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\\nGot it. And maybe if I could ask one last one on dividend timing. I think you guys usually take that out midyear. Any plans to make that more consistent over the course of the year?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah. As we told you, I mean, usually, that's in the June-July framework, that's when we usually take the dividend out and that's normal practice.\\nAlex Scott -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\\nOkay. All right. Thank you.\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nThank you.\\nOperator\\nJimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan, your line is open.\\nJimmy Bhullar -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\\nHi. Good morning. So first, I just had a question on your assumption review, and you took down interest rate assumptions by almost 120 basis points to a fairly conservative level. I'm assuming you're not planning on adjusting again as you go through your annual review process in 3Q. But obviously, as we get to 2022, based on current rates, you'll have to have another adjustment, but should we assume that if you were to bring that down further, the impact on your results would be fairly proportional with what it was or r does it increase or reduce as you go to lower and lower levels?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. So Jimmy, as you said, I mean, we adjusted the assumptions pretty significantly this quarter. And I think we're probably the most conservative company right now when it comes to interest rate assumptions.\\nThe way we do it, we actually take the five-year average of the interest rate curve and take that after long-term assumption and trade it over 10 years. So I don't see too much vola then Anders will take you through our balance sheet and results; and lastly, Nick will give an update on what we're seeing in April and talk about the robustness of our business model.\\nSo now turning to Slide 3. During this terrible pandemic and its tremendous human and economic challenges, Equitable has a special role to play. It is times like this that we, Equitable, show our role in society.\\nOur purpose is to protect families and secure the financial well-being of our clients, so they can live long and fulfilling lives. And I'm so proud of the ingenuity and commitment of our people in delivering exactly this. 98% of the Equitable workforce is working remotely today. And of course, we are supporting our people with a comprehensive stay well program. They've done a remarkable job at accelerating our digital outreach, launching new planning tools and keeping the highest levels of service and advice to our clients.\\nWe recognize also that we are part of a wider community and that many in society need an extra hand now. Through the Equitable Foundation, we have been providing financial support, particularly geared toward feeding and educating children.\\nToday, we'll talk about earnings for the first quarter, but it's most important now that we cover the strength of our balance sheet and how our business model will fare in these volatile times. Equitable has a resilient balance sheet. Our RBC ratio is approximately 450% to 475%. We have over $1 billion of liquidity at Equitable Holdings and nearly $7 billion at Equitable Life. Our strong position today is the result of a decade-long risk management program. This includes strategies to remove basis risk exposure, pioneering volatility management tools and introducing new categories for products like buffered annuities.\\nAnd at all times, we've maintained a high-quality fixed income portfolio with strong emphasis on diversification. Most importantly, we hedge to our full economic liabilities. This means that we immunize our balance sheet to interest rates. We managed to a near zero duration gap despite a regulatory framework that is slow to react to sharp falls in interest rates. And today, still permits reverting to a 3.5% or higher interest rate level.\\nOur resilience comes not from what we've done in the past quarter or what we have done over the past decade. Looking at the first quarter results, a strong quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings per common share amounted to $1.08, up 10% year-over-year, reflecting higher AUM and delivery of our productivity and GA rebalancing strategies.\\nIn Q1 and through the end of April, we are seeing limited adverse experience on COVID-19 mortality and minimal increase in lapses or withdrawals. Recurring premium flows are solid. For April, the first month of significant disruption and social distancing, new business activity across the board was about 70% of normal levels.\\nAs of the quarter end, our AUM across both Equitable and AllianceBernstein, excluding any double count, was $646 billion, down 12% from December 31, 2019. Despite this, we remain on track to meet our stated capitalization, payout ratio and $75 million net savings targets.\\nNow looking forward, the economic outlook is, of course, uncertain, even unknown. We will not be providing today an economic forecast for what is to happen. We don't know. We will, however, reaffirm market sensitivity of our earnings, in line with prior guidance of $150 million per annum for a 10% equity market decline.\\nWe see no advantage in trying to anchor to one scenario. We know, however, it is important today, not only to give comfort about our balance sheet, but also to show you why we believe Equitable's business model is able to adapt to create value across a broad range of future scenarios.\\nWe can adapt and create value for three reasons. Firstly, remember that our large in-force portfolio gives us stability. For the year 2020, 95% of our operating revenues will come from our policies in-force on January the 1st.\\nSecond, there are three features unique about our business model. One, we have a histo ratio of approximately 450% to 475%, this implies a pro forma RBC of approximately 390% to 520% under this total range of stress scenarios, maintaining our dividend capability and capitalization in excess of the Company's 375% to 400% minimum RBC target.\\nAlso, as a reminder, we were an early adopter of the NAIC VA reform, which utilizes a more conservative RBC calculation referenced here versus those who have not adopted. While we recognize that no two crisis or shocks are the same and that we are certainly not immune to losses, we are defensively positioned, strongly capitalized and well prepared to both protect our balance sheet and capitalize on unique investment opportunities within our risk framework.\\nI will now hand the call over to Nick to shed more light on how the business is operating in the current landscape.\\nNick Lane -- President of Equitable\\nThank you, Anders. As you saw, we had strong momentum in the first quarter, but we now face a very different environment.\\nWe remain steadfast in our focus on three areas outlined here on Page 10: guiding our clients through these volatile times and adapting our businesses to support them; magnifying our outreach to the communities we proudly serve; and as always, taking care of our employees, ensuring they're wealthy.\\nOn the first pillar, we've been pivoting our business processes, leveraging our remote capabilities to serve our clients. Our affiliated sales force with 4,300 advisors nationwide is providing advice directly to roughly 3 million Americans. The health pandemic has generated increased interest in protection products. We have implemented refined COVID-19 underwriting policies, modifying the need for invasive blood and fluid requirements, while deploying new national and state policy guidelines on premium forbearance.\\nOn our second pillar, we're magnifying our outreach to the communities we serve. Americans daily lives have fundamentally changed and we have launched several programs to help. The loss of peace of mind, social connectivity and increased family demands are taking a toll on people's mental well being. Through efforts such as our plan what you can program, we are helping people pull through this difficult period by planning new norms and rituals.\\nIn addition, as a firm, we are active in direct relief efforts, donating supplies to local medical facilities and committing $1 million to help community activities, which keep kids learning, feed the hungry and support center for disease control activities.\\nFinally, ensuring our employees can deliver on our mission while remaining safe is a critical priority. We see advisors and clients working remotely using our full suite of digital engagement, processing and servicing tools to ensure access to their financial assets, awareness of the policy benefits and relief actions.\\nWe expect this digital amplification to open up new opportunities for the future. As Mark mentioned, this is when our mission to help Americans secure long and fulfilling lives comes to the forefront. And I'm very proud of the way our teams have responded.\\nOur business model remains robust and adaptable, driven by the three factors outlined here on Page 11. First, our products remain profitable and in demand. Over the past decade, innovation in designing resilient products anchored in economic realities has been at our core.\\nToday, we are the market leader of structured annuities, providing upside potential and downside protection, helping clients in these volatile markets. While on the protection side, we have a robust product portfolio, focused on capital-light sectors like VUL to address enhanced mortality concerns.\\nAs Anders highlighted, we have been a pioneer in taking meaningful product and in-force actions, drive better risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders and clients. Next, our distribution size and breadth provides privileged ways to access clients. Equitable advisors or affiliated sales force gives us direct access to end client needs and behaviors.\\nThrough many volatile times, it has provided stable, profitable growth a ds. This measure, which considers our credit risk, impacts the calculation of the estimated fair value of liabilities.\\nFor additional context, should credit spreads narrow, we would expect the opposite impact. To reiterate, this impact during the quarter helped to illustrate precisely why we believe operating earnings is the best proxy for analyzing our performance. As equities sharply declined and interest rates fell in the first quarter, our adjustment was positive, in line with our expectations and previously communicated guidance.\\nFinally, other adjustments to net income this quarter primarily include impacts related to the realignment of GAAP interest rate assumptions in our Protection Solutions and Group Retirement segments and taxes. I would now like to highlight our capital and liquidity position outlined on Slide 8.\\nAs Mark mentioned earlier, the challenging economic environment this quarter has truly allowed us to demonstrate the strength and resiliency of our balance sheet. Last quarter, we announced our new minimum capitalization target of 375% to 400% RBC.\\nThis quarter, despite the S&P falling 20% and U.S. Treasury rates reaching historic lows, we closed the quarter with an RBC ratio of 450% to 475%, continuing to remain well in excess of our minimum target, including CTE98 for VAs. Our hedging target is the economic liability, which assumes the forward curve for interest rates compared to the statutory framework, which relies on a 3.5% reversion to mean assumption. Because we are fully hedged on interest rates, we are overhedged on a statutory basis. This does not imply that we have more excess capital, rather, the increase in assets match the movements in our economic liabilities.\\nAs a result, the interest rate hedge gains protected our RBC during this highly volatile quarter. In terms of liquidity, our well-diversified sources helped to further fortify our balance sheet. As of the end of the first quarter, cash and liquid assets were approximately $1 billion at the holding company, above our $500 million minimum target.\\nAt our insurance company, cash and liquid assets are nearly $7 billion as a result of hedging to our economic liabilities. This is not distributable capital as it is backing our economic liabilities. Between ongoing quarterly distributions from AllianceBernstein and the annual Life company dividend, we anticipate midyear, we are well positioned to continue generating strong cash flows from our operating entities.\\nOur strong position is further enhanced by the additional liquidity levers we already have in place, including $4.4 billion of credit lines and $1 billion in contingent capital through P-Caps. In the first quarter, we returned $274 million to shareholders, including $69 million to quarterly cash dividend and $205 million of share buyback.\\nIn addition, we intend to increase our quarterly dividend by $0.02 to $0.17 per share payable in the second quarter. As a result of our financial strength and cash flow generation, our capital management program remains on target. Furthermore, if equity markets are sustained at current levels through year-end, we expect to continue to deliver on the 50% to 60% target payout ratio.\\nMoving to our investment portfolio on Page 9. I want to continue to illustrate how our risk management framework has placed us in a strong position to withstand a wide range of adverse and severe credit scenario, while still maintaining a robust capital position. We take a conservative approach to managing our general account, actively managing risk and investing in a diversified mix of high-quality assets.\\nAs of quarter end, over 70% of our portfolio was invested in corporates and treasuries and 98% of our fixed maturities were investment-grade with an average portfolio rating of A2. Our corporate bond portfolio has an average credit rating of A3 and is well diversified across geography and industry, leaving us with a limited exposure to challenged sectors such as energy and transportation.\\nOur commercial mortgage loans are characterized by high-quality collaterals loc s an anchor tenant in driving new commercial solutions and pivoting our product mix. In parallel, we have a deep third-party distribution partner network of over 1,100 firms, with leading positions in key channels, which cannot be quickly replicated.\\nAnd finally, we have leadership scale in resilient segments. We have built scale in focused market segments. We're the number one provider of public sector retirement solutions for kindergarten to 12th grade educators, which we believe is more immune to economic downturns. And as a leader in the retirement market, as the number two variable annuity player, we are well positioned to help people prepare for their next life chapters, especially in these volatile times. While AB, given its global footprint and broad investment offers, provides deep investment expertise. For the discrete month of April, our core activity indicators remain solid.\\nFor Equitable Life, demand for advice remains strong. We've seen a 20% increase in client engagement activities, while new business flows in April are running at roughly 70% of normal levels. Net flows are stable, supported by the reoccurring premium aspect of our business lines.\\nWhile our in-force, which represents 95% of our revenues, has not experienced meaningful outflows. Sadly, we have seen initial COVID-related claims, which through April were approximately $40 million gross before accounting for any offsets. For our subsidiary, AB, we saw positive net flows through April, following first quarter outflows concentrated in March.\\nIn summary, our business remains resilient. Our commercial teams will continue to pivot to ensure we deliver for our clients and communities during this period. With that said, I'd like to hand the call back to Mark for closing comments.\\nMark Pearson -- Chief Executive Officer and President\\nThank you, Nick. Thank you, Anders. Before opening to questions, I'd just like to close by expressing my pride in these results. I'm proud of how the people of Equitable have rallied together during these challenging times.\\nBut most of all, I'm proud of what the team has done over the past decade to build a resilient balance sheet and robust business model, ensuring that Equitable continues to be a force for good, providing American families with advice and solutions to help them secure their financial futures, while providing our shareholders with attractive return on their investments.\\nNow I'd like to hand it back to the operator for questions and answers.\\nQuestions and Answers:\\nOperator\\nCertainly. [Operator Instructions] Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo, your line is open.\\nElyse Greenspan -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\\nHi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question, you mentioned that there was $40 million of losses in April from COVID. Can you just provide a little bit more color on where you're seeing the losses? And how we should think about them hitting your segments? I'm assuming a good chunk would be in Protection. And then just how we should think about modeling that for both April and then going forward for the balance of the year?\\nMark Pearson -- Chief Executive Officer and President\\nThanks for your question, Elyse. Anders, will you deal with that one, please?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. Of course, Mark. Thanks, Elyse. Good morning. So as Nick said, we saw about $40 million gross claims and -- through April. If we take the Fauci scenario, the lower end of the Fauci scenario, about 100,000 tests for the total U.S. and translate with what we know today, there's still a lot of uncertainty. We would probably get to somewhere between $100 million to $130 million net impact then to earnings. That's kind of the range I can give you right now, but there's still a lot of uncertainty around.\\nElyse Greenspan -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\\nOkay. That's helpful. And then my second question, you guys had mentioned in April that new business was around 70% of normal. Just hoping for -- if there's any more color you can give in terms of thinking about new business trends going forward beyond Apri l?\\nAnd then can you give us like a rule of thumb, as you write less new business, how much capital that could potentially free up?\\nMark Pearson -- Chief Executive Officer and President\\nElyse, why don't I just set the context? I'll ask Nick just to talk quickly about the segments and then Anders can go. And obviously, it would not be prudent of us at this stage to give any forecast going forward. We -- it's just too much unknown going on.\\nI think the thing to remember is from Nick's comments in there, we're looking at new business. Obviously, it's important over the long term. But in the short term, certainly for 2020, 95% of revenues will come from policies we had in-force at the 1st of January. The book is behaving well. Recurring premiums are strong. We're not seeing any outflows or anything like that. So in the short term, revenues look OK.\\nRunning at about 70%, as Nick said, we think that's absolutely remarkable because this was the first month of social distancing, huge upheaval to how people normally operate. So we're very, very happy with what we're seeing in that first month. And the adaptability and the ability to pivot that Nick spoke about is very, very evident as we say.\\nNick, just give us a little bit of color across the segments, I think that will help.\\nNick Lane -- President of Equitable\\nSure. First, for Individual Retirement, 85% of our sales are coming from product lines like SCS or structured annuity notes. As you saw, we were up 11% last quarter. So we've got confidence given the upside potential and downside protection that it's right for these volatile times.\\nOverall, Equitable advisors, our affiliated sales force continues to give us access directly to clients' needs and their behaviors.\\nSo for IR, we're running at about 70% of total capacity for normal business flows. In the Group Retirement space, the public sector remains immune. Teachers are fully employed and extremely active. They're doing heroic things in distance learning as I can attest with three kids.\\nNot surprisingly, we did see a decline in new teacher applications as we continue to focus on our existing million educators through this period.\\nAnd given, as was mentioned -- given the renewals and recurring nature of our retirement solutions, flows remain solid.\\nOn Protection, we are seeing an enhanced interest in Protection-type products. We have pivoted toward our express underwriting for term and modified our -- some of our policies capping the face amounts that we will provide without bloods and fluids.\\nSo the ranges within that $70 million would be down 50% in certain lines and to about 10%, but it's still unknown.\\nWe continue to focus on our clients. And we believe that given our remote outreach and magnifying our voice that's going to present and position us well to emerge stronger on the other side.\\nAnders, do you want to chip in there?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah. Look, just quickly on your question about the impact from sales on our balance sheet. But as we said before, I mean, the balance sheet is very strong. And I don't think that the sales -- obviously, we monitor the sales, but this will have no impact on the balance sheet in this period.\\nElyse Greenspan -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\\nOkay. Thank you for the color.\\nOperator\\nTom Gallagher with Evercore, your line is open.\\nThomas Gallagher -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\nGood morning. A question on -- Anders, if you're overhedged on the new statutory framework because that's using mean reversion and you're not, shouldn't your RBC ratio have gone up in a quarter where rates plunge like they did?\\nAnd because it didn't, is the difference due to the use of treasuries as part of the hedging program?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. So Tom, look, I think the RBC, as you said, I mean, uses the mean reversion still and going back to 3.5% and we hedge to the forward curve.\\nSo we overhedged statutory on the interest rates. But as you say, we use our treasuries really to hedge about 20%, 25% of it. So it's about $2 billion gains that we have that di l?\\nAnd then can you give us like a rule of thumb, as you write less new business, how much capital that could potentially free up?\\nMark Pearson -- Chief Executive Officer and President\\nElyse, why don't I just set the context? I'll ask Nick just to talk quickly about the segments and then Anders can go. And obviously, it would not be prudent of us at this stage to give any forecast going forward.

They're doing heroic things in distance learning as I can attest with three kids.\\nNot surprisingly, we did see  dn't flow through the statutory and P&L. So it didn't flow through the RBC.\\nAnd then as you know, I mean, you don't hedge the base products. So we have exposure on the base fee. So that's why overall, I think, the balance sheet is very strong on RBC and it doesn't reflect the hedges that go through the general account.\\nThomas Gallagher -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\nThat makes sense. So what would happen if rates continue to go down and it negatively impacted your RBC, would the plan be to sell and rebuy treasury securities to book the gain or how should I think about that?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nSo first of all, I mean, as we said, we hedge to the economic liabilities and I think that's foremost, that's our target. And then I said a portion goes through the general account. So I don't expect that this will change. I think that's a very strong hedge we have. I don't give you the projections on RBC, but I can guarantee you that we manage that to make sure that we are above our target.\\nThomas Gallagher -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\nGot it. And I know New York has implemented their own variable annuity standards. Just in light of what they've announced, are you still confident in getting dividends out of your New York subsidiary on a consistent basis despite that rule change? Thanks.\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah, right. Look, as we discussed during the last call a quarter ago, I mean, New York has this new rollout. It's a New York floor. We discussed at that time as well that I think in the short term, it's not that impactful, but it will -- it can become problematic, in particular, if markets go up.\\nRight now, I think it's the opposite. So we feel very confident in the short term. But it's something we have to work with New York and to make sure that we have sustainable dividend even in the long term.\\nThomas Gallagher -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\nOkay. Thanks. And then just if I could sneak one more in. The -- regarding your reduction in future interest rate assumptions for GAAP accounting, is that going to have a depressing impact on baseline earnings from this point forward?\\nI know there's probably some offsetting items there because there's a lower DAC asset, but probably the lower roll-forward of discount rate, I presume would play some pressure on GAAP earnings?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nRight. So maybe first and foremost, I think it's important that we have prudent assumptions in our accounting framework. Even though, I mean, as we said before, we manage to the forward rate.\\nBut the -- GAAP is not a fair value on framework, that's why we -- I think we use a very prudent and interest rate assumption going forward. This is just reflecting reality.\\nNow the biggest impact is really on Protection Solutions because of the accounting change, Protection Solutions falls back into loss recognition. And that makes Protection Solutions more volatile, but I think that's really the key issue.\\nWhat is important here as well, I mean, it really brings us just closer to the FASB target improvement framework, which we support, as you know.\\nThomas Gallagher -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\nOkay. Thanks.\\nOperator\\nSuneet Kamath with Citi, your line is open.\\nSuneet Kamath -- Citi -- Analyst\\nThanks. I wanted to go to the 50% to 60% payout ratio. Just to make sure I heard the prepared remarks correctly. So I think you had said something along the lines of that assumes equity markets are stable to April.\\nSo if we go back to, say, March 31 equity market levels, would you expect an impact on that payout ratio?\\nMark Pearson -- Chief Executive Officer and President\\nHi, Suneet. It's Mark. Let me deal with that one. Yes, as you said, we expect to achieve our target payout ratio for the year, but two conditions. Firstly, as always, that we can maintain strong management of the capital and liquidity, in particular, that we can meet our true economic liabilities.\\nAnd so far, so good there. Our portfolio continues to produce strong cash flows, hedging is working very well. And as you heard from Anders, capita ing times.\\nBut most of all, I'm proud of what the team has done over the past decade to build a resilient balance sheet and robust business model, ensuring that Equitable continues to be a force for good, providing American families with advice and solutions to help them secure their financial futures, while providing our shareholders with attractive return on their investments.\\nNow I'd like to hand it back to the operator for questions and answers.\\nQuestions and Answers:\\nOperator\\nCertainly.

Before opening to questions, I'd just like to close by expressing my pride in these results. I'm proud of how the people of Equitable have rallied together during these challenging times.\\nBut most of all, I'm proud of what the team has done over the past decade to build a resilient balance sheet and robust business model, ensuring that Equitable continues to be a force for good, providing American families with advice and solutions to help them secure their financial futures, while providing our shareholders with attractive return on their investments.\\nNow I'd like to hand it back to the operator for questions and answers.\\nQuestions and Answers:\\nOperator\\nCertainly. [Operator Instructions] Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo, your line is open.\\nElyse Greenspan -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\\nHi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question, you mentioned that there was $40 million of losses in April from COVID. Can you just provide a little bit more color on where you're seeing the losses? And how we should think about them hitting your segments? I'm assuming a good chunk would be in Protection. And then just how we should think about modeling that for both April and then going forward for the balance of the year?\\nMark Pearson -- Chief Executive Officer and President\\nThanks for your question, Elyse. Anders, will you deal with that one, please?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. Of course, Mark. Thanks, Elyse. Good morning. So as Nick said, we saw about $40 million gross claims and -- through April. If we take the Fauci scenario, the lower end of the Fauci scenario, about 100,000 tests for the total U.S. and translate with what we know today, there's still a lot of uncertainty. We would probably get to somewhere between $100 million to $130 million net impact then to earnings. That's kind of the range I can give you right now, but there's still a lot of uncertainty around.\\nElyse Greenspan -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\\nOkay. That's helpful. And then my second question, you guys had mentioned in April that new business was around 70% of normal.

Before opening to questions, I'd just like to close by expressing my pride in these results. I'm proud of how the people of Equitable have rallied together during these challeng od morning. Anders, you mentioned that you're advocating for the NAIC to change the mean reversion interest rate assumptions under STAT. I guess, can you just give us any update on if you think there's a chance that, that would happen and that they do kind of change the current methodology?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah, I would love to do so, Ryan. Good morning. But then I think this is outside of my range to predict and what regulators are doing.\\nBut look, again, I think what we just advocate here making sure that we appropriately evaluate our liabilities and make sure that on both sides of the balance sheet we have a fair value approach. I think that's the only way we have a fair representation of our liabilities, and we can actually manage our liabilities and going forward. And that's really what we're advocating for, is it under STAT? Is it under GAAP? And that's why we use our economic model, which is a full fair value model.\\nBut I cannot predict what the regulators are doing, I can just advocate in one direction.\\nRyan Krueger -- Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods -- Analyst\\nGot it. And then on the $100 million to $130 million potential COVID claims for 100,000 deaths, it seems kind of high. I guess, is that because you have a higher market share in the New York Metro Area and you adjusted the estimate to account for that?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nNo. What we did, Ryan, is really we just took the current data that we see coming out of this end of April. So -- and we just try to link that back to our portfolio. It is very hard right now to do that because there's many factors that have to go in here. It's the age. It's the region. It's the social environment people live in.\\nSo that's why we give this range. I feel confident with the range, but I -- look, I tell you, this is a lot of uncertainty here that's why we gave you that range.\\nRyan Krueger -- Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods -- Analyst\\nThank you.\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions]\\nAlex Scott with Goldman Sachs, your line is open.\\nAlex Scott -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\\nHi. Good morning. My question is just on the liquidity position in the operating company. I mean, it sounds like that went up pretty substantially. So I was just interested if you could talk about that and if it's related at all to reallocation, if there's a -- if we should expect sort of a drag on the yield you are earning or if it's kind of incremental assets related to the hedge program, if there's some extra income that will be produced there? Just help us think about that liquidity position and how it will affect things?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes, good morning, Alex. And yes, right, absolutely, since we have the hedging program in place, we had a lot of inflows in March. And so this additional liquidity is really coming from the hedging program. So it's additional liquidity. It's really from the cash settlement of the derivatives.\\nAnd we want to keep that flexibility right now because there's still a lot of uncertainty. That's why we have a much higher cash position than usually. So it is incremental. It's not because we liquidated assets.\\nAlex Scott -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\\nGot it. So no go-forward drag from that?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nRight.\\nAlex Scott -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\\nOkay. And then next question I had is just when I think about loss recognition in Protection and the comments that were made around just increased volatility, which I understand, will that sort of change the way that the COVID-19 impact your financial statement? And what I mean by that is you gave your range in terms of, like, what the incremental claims could be, but is there anything about being in loss recognition and that volatility that occurs from that, that could cause the swings related to the COVID-19 claims to kind of come through in an abnormal way?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah. So as we said, I mean, we have went back into loss recognition. It's really driven by the interest rate assumption change. So that's the main  million minimum target.\\nAt our insurance company, cash and liquid assets are nearly $7 billion as a result of hedging to our economic liabilities. This is not distributable capital as it is backing our economic liabilities. Between ongoing quarterly distributions from AllianceBernstein and the annual Life company dividend, we anticipate midyear, we are well positioned to continue generating strong cash flows from our operating entities.\\nOur strong position is further enhanced by the additional liquidity levers we already have in place, including $4.4 billion of credit lines and $1 billion in contingent capital through P-Caps. In the first quarter, we returned $274 million to shareholders, including $69 million to quarterly cash dividend and $205 million of share buyback.\\nIn addition, we intend to increase our quarterly dividend by $0.02 to $0.17 per share payable in the second quarter. As a result of our financial strength and cash flow generation, our capital management program remains on target. Furthermore, if equity markets are sustained at current levels through year-end, we expect to continue to deliver on the 50% to 60% target payout ratio.\\nMoving to our investment portfolio on Page 9. I want to continue to illustrate how our risk management framework has placed us in a strong position to withstand a wide range of adverse and severe credit scenario, while still maintaining a robust capital position. We take a conservative approach to managing our general account, actively managing risk and investing in a diversified mix of high-quality assets.\\nAs of quarter end, over 70% of our portfolio was invested in corporates and treasuries and 98% of our fixed maturities were investment-grade with an average portfolio rating of A2. Our corporate bond portfolio has an average credit rating of A3 and is well diversified across geography and industry, leaving us with a limited exposure to challenged sectors such as energy and transportation.\\nOur commercial mortgage loans are characterized by high-quality collaterals located in major metro areas with well capitalized borrowers, representing approximately 11% of our overall portfolio. We also have limited exposure to alternatives at approximately 2% of our investment portfolio, which are highly diversified across strategies, geographies and vintages.\\nFinally, we have limited investment in structured securities, including approximately 1.5% of CLO exposure and 0% in CMBS. And while we can't know the full depth, magnitude or duration of impact the current crisis will present. We can say that looking at the portfolio through the length of historical high sigma events, we feel confident that we are well prepared.\\nTo illustrate this point, we show here two stress scenarios: one, on our investment portfolio, reflecting default rates and ratings migration observed during the 2008 financial crisis. Leveraging two different methodologies, our analysis estimate that default losses in a 2008-type scenario, assuming no offsetting management actions would result in up to $150 million in losses in the first year and up to $430 million over three years.\\nWhile most industry scenarios assume 2008 stress levels, we thought it's prudent to evaluate a deep stress scenario that assumes impacts that are two times more severe than 2008. Under this deep stress scenario, potential losses would be $300 million in the first year and up to $860 million over three years. While these figures are not insignificant, it's important to contextualize them with respect to the Company's balance sheet, cash flow and earnings power.\\nEvaluating the impact of both defaults and migration on required capital, we estimate a cumulative three-year 77-point impact to our RBC ratio under the stress scenario and 144-point three-year impact under the deep stress scenario. Even assuming no equity market recovery from April levels, we would still expect the business to generate cash flows translating to 60 RBC points in year two and three, totaling an additional 120 RBC points, before dividend to the holdco.\\nGiven our current RBC  Prepared Remarks:\\nOperator\\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to Equitable Holdings First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker for today, Jessica Baehr, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\\nJessica Baehr -- Head of Investor Relations\\nThank you. Good morning, and welcome to Equitable Holdings first quarter 2020 earnings call. Materials for today's call can be found on our website at ir.equitableholdings.com.\\nBefore we begin, I would like to note that some of the information we present today is forward-looking and subject to certain SEC rules and regulations regarding disclosure. Our results may materially differ from those expressed in or indicated by such forward-looking statements. So I'd like to point out the Safe Harbor language on Slide 2 of our presentation. You can also find our Safe Harbor language in our 10-Q.\\nJoining me on today's call is Mark Pearson, President and Chief Executive Officer of Equitable Holdings; Anders Malmstrom, our Chief Financial Officer; and Nick Lane, President of Equitable Life. Also on the line is John Weisenseel, AllianceBernstein's Chief Financial Officer.\\nDuring this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures that are not based on generally accepted accounting principles, also known as non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and related definitions may be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website, in our earnings release, slide presentation and financial supplement.\\nI would now like to turn the call over to Mark, Anders and Nick for their prepared remarks.\\nMark Pearson -- Chief Executive Officer and President\\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. It's obviously a difficult time for most people. So first and most importantly, I hope that you and your families are all safe and well.\\nWe're going to try and do three things today. I'm going to give an overview, then Anders will take you through our balance sheet and results; and lastly, Nick will give an update on what we're seeing in April and talk about the robustness of our business model.\\nSo now turning to Slide 3. During this terrible pandemic and its tremendous human and economic challenges, Equitable has a special role to play. It is times like this that we, Equitable, show our role in society.\\nOur purpose is to protect families and secure the financial well-being of our clients, so they can live long and fulfilling lives. And I'm so proud of the ingenuity and commitment of our people in delivering exactly this. 98% of the Equitable workforce is working remotely today. And of course, we are supporting our people with a comprehensive stay well program. They've done a remarkable job at accelerating our digital outreach, launching new planning tools and keeping the highest levels of service and advice to our clients.\\nWe recognize also that we are part of a wider community and that many in society need an extra hand now. Through the Equitable Foundation, we have been providing financial support, particularly geared toward feeding and educating children.\\nToday, we'll talk about earnings for the first quarter, but it's most important now that we cover the strength of our balance sheet and how our business model will fare in these volatile times. Equitable has a resilient balance sheet. Our RBC ratio is approximately 450% to 475%. We have over $1 billion of liquidity at Equitable Holdings and nearly $7 billion at Equitable Life. Our strong position today is the result of a decade-long risk management program. This includes strategies to remove basis risk exposure, pioneering volatility management tools and introducing new categories for products like buffered annuities.\\nAnd at all times, we've maintained a high-quality fixed income portfolio with strong emphasis on diversification. Most importantly, we hedge to our full economic liabilities. This means that we immunize our balance sheet to interest rates. We managed to  od morning. Anders, you mentioned that you're advocating for the NAIC to change the mean reversion interest rate assumptions under STAT. I guess, can you just give us any update on if you think there's a chance that, that would happen and that they do kind of change the current methodology?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah, I would love to do so, Ryan.

And that's why we use our economic model, which is a full fair value model.\\nBut I cannot predict what the regulators are doing, I can just advocate in one direction.\\nRyan Krueger -- Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods -- Analyst\\nGot it. And then on the $100 million to $130 million potential COVID claims for 100,000 deaths, it seems kind of high.

Good morning. My question is just on the liquidity position in the operating company. I mean, it sounds like that went up pretty substantially.

So no go-forward drag from that?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nRight.\\nAlex Scott -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\\nOkay. And then next question I had is just when I think about loss recognition in Protection and the comments that were made around just increased volatility, which I understand, will that sort of change the way that the COVID-19 impact your financial statement? And what I mean by that is you gave your range in terms of, like, what the incremental claims could be, but is there anything about being in loss recognition and that volatility that occurs from that, that could cause the swings related to the COVID-19 claims to kind of come through in an abnormal way?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah. So as we said, I mean, we have went back into loss recognition. It's really driven by the interest rate assumption change. So that's the main  unting, is that going to have a depressing impact on baseline earnings from this point forward?\\nI know there's probably some offsetting items there because there's a lower DAC asset, but probably the lower roll-forward of discount rate, I presume would play some pressure on GAAP earnings?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nRight. So maybe first and foremost, I think it's important that we have prudent assumptions in our accounting framework. Even though, I mean, as we said before, we manage to the forward rate.\\nBut the -- GAAP is not a fair value on framework, that's why we -- I think we use a very prudent and interest rate assumption going forward. This is just reflecting reality.\\nNow the biggest impact is really on Protection Solutions because of the accounting change, Protection Solutions falls back into loss recognition. And that makes Protection Solutions more volatile, but I think that's really the key issue.\\nWhat is important here as well, I mean, it really brings us just closer to the FASB target improvement framework, which we support, as you know.\\nThomas Gallagher -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\nOkay. Thanks.\\nOperator\\nSuneet Kamath with Citi, your line is open.\\nSuneet Kamath -- Citi -- Analyst\\nThanks. I wanted to go to the 50% to 60% payout ratio. Just to make sure I heard the prepared remarks correctly. So I think you had said something along the lines of that assumes equity markets are stable to April.\\nSo if we go back to, say, March 31 equity market levels, would you expect an impact on that payout ratio?\\nMark Pearson -- Chief Executive Officer and President\\nHi, Suneet. It's Mark. Let me deal with that one. Yes, as you said, we expect to achieve our target payout ratio for the year, but two conditions. Firstly, as always, that we can maintain strong management of the capital and liquidity, in particular, that we can meet our true economic liabilities.\\nAnd so far, so good there. Our portfolio continues to produce strong cash flows, hedging is working very well. And as you heard from Anders, capital ratios are healthy.\\nAnd secondly, and obviously, we've got off with [Phonetic] somewhat normal economic conditions. And for the past several weeks and certainly back in March time, it certainly wasn't normal conditions, but markets have slowly come back, we've adapted.\\nAnd under current conditions, we should be able to meet our target for 2020 on the payout ratio.\\nSuneet Kamath -- Citi -- Analyst\\nRight. I'm just trying to get a sense of is that -- if we do go back to March 31 equity market levels, how much of an impact could that have on that payout ratio?\\nMark Pearson -- Chief Executive Officer and President\\nI think the only thing we can give you is that sensitivity what we said to earnings, and that is if markets are down 10% for a full year, that would hit earnings by $150 million.\\nYou can make your own assumptions from that.\\nSuneet Kamath -- Citi -- Analyst\\nOkay. And then the second question was on the AB stake. I think, Anders, earlier in the year, you talked about a review of the stake and getting back to investors at some point in 2020. Is that still under way?\\nAnd just curious if the impact of COVID and all the uncertainty that's causing is going to change the timing of any announcement that you guys might make on that?\\nMark Pearson -- Chief Executive Officer and President\\nSuneet, yeah, your memory is correct. We did indeed say that. But as you indicated in your question, I mean, quarter ONE has been really focused on maintaining the strength of the balance sheet; secondly, supporting our people and our clients.\\nAnd then, as Nick outlined, adapting the business model. So I think, as we said before on AB, look, we're comfortable with the 65%. It's our norm. We will get to look at it. But you're right, we haven't done anything in this quarter ONE, it's certainly not our priority.\\nSuneet Kamath -- Citi -- Analyst\\nOkay. Got it. Thank you.\\nMark Pearson -- Chief Executive Officer and President\\nThanks.\\nOperator\\nRyan Krueger with KBW, your line is open.\\nRyan Krueger -- Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods -- Analyst\\nHi. Go  our Life company, no reliance on a future reversion to mean interest rate and a business model, which is proving its robustness at a time of extreme disruption.\\nLet me hand over now to Anders to go into more detail. Anders?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nThank you, Mark. Now turning to Slide 4. As Mark discussed, our economic model is the cornerstone of our prudent risk management, protecting our balance sheet from declines in interest rates and equity markets. And this quarter perfectly demonstrated why managing to an economic framework is so critical.\\nThose who follow us have seen elements of this page before. As this slide shows, reversion to mean interest rate assumptions under U.S. GAAP and statutory framework vary across the industry and provide a false sense of security in terms of reserving requirements.\\nOur economic balance sheet is protected from interest rates as we use the forward curve and risk neutral scenarios, including negative rates and do not make predictions about future interest rating.\\nWe are fully hedged and duration matched, ensuring our economic assets match our economic liabilities, protecting our balance sheet and future cash flows. The risk gap and statutory frameworks, both currently rely on reversion to mean assumptions to calculate reserves with some insurers still using long-term rates as high as 5%.\\nThis is completely disconnected from the reality of current rates. The truth is, we simply do not know where interest rates are headed, and we do not believe it is prudent for clients or shareholders to take a position here and expose our balance sheet to unnecessary risk. As you can see on the slide, have we managed to our liabilities under GAAP or STAT, we would have been underhedged to our true economic liability by approximately $7 billion and $2 billion, respectively. Our U.S. GAAP financial results perfectly highlights this disconnect between the accounting treatment and the actual movement of our underlying assets and liabilities.\\nAs we hedge to our economic liabilities, the outsized hedge gains we realized this quarter are not, in fact, real gains, but instead reflects an increase in our economic assets to match our economic liabilities. We believe it is important to move away from reversion to mean standards. And we are strongly advocating for the reforms that move GAAP accounting and statutory basis closer to an economic framework.\\nWe are pleased that FASB target improvements largely addresses the uneconomic accounting mismatch of assets and liabilities and believe implementation will help to make GAAP accounting more transparent for investors and more relevant for the insurance sector.\\nMoving on to Slide 5. Our balance sheet strength and continued resilience is the result of intentional prudent management actions that have taken place over the past decade.\\nIn the midst of last financial crisis, we successfully shifted the risk profile of our in-force and new business. Notably, we were one of the first in the industry to develop our own proprietary volatility managed funds. Through a series of fund actions that increased the passivity and volatility management coverage of our guaranteed assets and eliminated unhedgeable asset classes, we reduced basis risk by between 85% and 90%.\\nHad we not taken these actions, losses would have accrued in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Over the past quarter, our volatility management tools not only protected our balance sheet, they also protected client assets from the severe market decline.\\nAs volatility spiked, our volatility managed funds triggered helping to preserve client assets. Similarly, our asset transfer program also initiated moving guaranteed assets under management into fixed income allocation funds.\\nThe prudent risk management is not a zero-sum game. Challenging times also present opportunities to innovate and emerge stronger as our history demonstrates. Following the last financial crisis, we launched the industry's first floating rate variable annuity return on cornerstone. That was comprised of 100% passive and  od morning. Anders, you mentioned that you're advocating for the NAIC to change the mean reversion interest rate assumptions under STAT. I guess, can you just give us any update on if you think there's a chance that, that would happen and that they do kind of change the current methodology?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah, I would love to do so, Ryan. Good morning. But then I think this is outside of my range to predict and what regulators are doing.\\nBut look, again, I think what we just advocate here making sure that we appropriately evaluate our liabilities and make sure that on both sides of the balance sheet we have a fair value approach. I think that's the only way we have a fair representation of our liabilities, and we can actually manage our liabilities and going forward. And that's really what we're advocating for, is it under STAT? Is it under GAAP? And that's why we use our economic model, which is a full fair value model.\\nBut I cannot predict what the regulators are doing, I can just advocate in one direction.\\nRyan Krueger -- Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods -- Analyst\\nGot it. And then on the $100 million to $130 million potential COVID claims for 100,000 deaths, it seems kind of high. I guess, is that because you have a higher market share in the New York Metro Area and you adjusted the estimate to account for that?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nNo. What we did, Ryan, is really we just took the current data that we see coming out of this end of April. So -- and we just try to link that back to our portfolio. It is very hard right now to do that because there's many factors that have to go in here. It's the age. It's the region. It's the social environment people live in.\\nSo that's why we give this range. I feel confident with the range, but I -- look, I tell you, this is a lot of uncertainty here that's why we gave you that range.\\nRyan Krueger -- Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods -- Analyst\\nThank you.\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions]\\nAlex Scott with Goldman Sachs, your line is open.\\nAlex Scott -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\\nHi. Good morning. My question is just on the liquidity position in the operating company. I mean, it sounds like that went up pretty substantially. So I was just interested if you could talk about that and if it's related at all to reallocation, if there's a -- if we should expect sort of a drag on the yield you are earning or if it's kind of incremental assets related to the hedge program, if there's some extra income that will be produced there? Just help us think about that liquidity position and how it will affect things?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes, good morning, Alex. And yes, right, absolutely, since we have the hedging program in place, we had a lot of inflows in March. And so this additional liquidity is really coming from the hedging program. So it's additional liquidity. It's really from the cash settlement of the derivatives.\\nAnd we want to keep that flexibility right now because there's still a lot of uncertainty. That's why we have a much higher cash position than usually. So it is incremental. It's not because we liquidated assets.\\nAlex Scott -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\\nGot it. So no go-forward drag from that?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nRight.\\nAlex Scott -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\\nOkay. And then next question I had is just when I think about loss recognition in Protection and the comments that were made around just increased volatility, which I understand, will that sort of change the way that the COVID-19 impact your financial statement? And what I mean by that is you gave your range in terms of, like, what the incremental claims could be, but is there anything about being in loss recognition and that volatility that occurs from that, that could cause the swings related to the COVID-19 claims to kind of come through in an abnormal way?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah. So as we said, I mean, we have went back into loss recognition. It's really driven by the interest rate assumption change. So that's the main  ss was solid. SCS sales improved 11% year-over-year. Group Retirement increased inflows by 20%, driven by growth in both first year and renewal premiums. AB had its strongest retail gross sales quarter ever, with over $24 billion.\\nAnd in Protection Solutions, we continued to drive gross premium growth in our Employee Benefit business. All in all, it was another strong quarter for Equitable. And while the current social and economic environment will certainly present challenges going forward, we are navigating the uncertainty on strong footing, thanks to the resilience of our balance sheet and business model.\\nTurning now to Slide 7. I would like to review the walk from net income to non-GAAP operating earnings. This slide perfectly illustrates the disconnect between the accounting treatment of insurance assets and liabilities under U.S. GAAP. As I previously mentioned, the hedge gains of $12 billion simply reflects an increase in our economic assets to cover our economic liabilities and should not be considered excess cash.\\nIncluded in the first quarter net income results of $5.4 billion were significant noneconomic items related to VA product features, driven by GMxB hedging, realigned interest assumptions and nonperformance risk. In light of the decline in interest rates this quarter, we realigned our long-term GAAP interest rate assumptions to grade from the current spot rate to 2.25% over 10 years, following the five-year historical average for the 10-year treasury.\\nThis change resulted in unfavorable impact to net income of $1.9 billion, more than offset by year-to-date economic interest rate hedge gains of $4.4 billion, resulting in a net impact of approximately $2.4 billion post-tax this quarter.\\nBy reflecting the interest rate accounting impact today, our GAAP financial results move closer to FASB targeted improvement implementation and importantly, more closely aligns with our economic model. Additionally, we saw a significant impact this quarter related to nonperformance risk due to widening credit spreads. This measure, which considers our credit risk, impacts the calculation of the estimated fair value of liabilities.\\nFor additional context, should credit spreads narrow, we would expect the opposite impact. To reiterate, this impact during the quarter helped to illustrate precisely why we believe operating earnings is the best proxy for analyzing our performance. As equities sharply declined and interest rates fell in the first quarter, our adjustment was positive, in line with our expectations and previously communicated guidance.\\nFinally, other adjustments to net income this quarter primarily include impacts related to the realignment of GAAP interest rate assumptions in our Protection Solutions and Group Retirement segments and taxes. I would now like to highlight our capital and liquidity position outlined on Slide 8.\\nAs Mark mentioned earlier, the challenging economic environment this quarter has truly allowed us to demonstrate the strength and resiliency of our balance sheet. Last quarter, we announced our new minimum capitalization target of 375% to 400% RBC.\\nThis quarter, despite the S&P falling 20% and U.S. Treasury rates reaching historic lows, we closed the quarter with an RBC ratio of 450% to 475%, continuing to remain well in excess of our minimum target, including CTE98 for VAs. Our hedging target is the economic liability, which assumes the forward curve for interest rates compared to the statutory framework, which relies on a 3.5% reversion to mean assumption. Because we are fully hedged on interest rates, we are overhedged on a statutory basis. This does not imply that we have more excess capital, rather, the increase in assets match the movements in our economic liabilities.\\nAs a result, the interest rate hedge gains protected our RBC during this highly volatile quarter. In terms of liquidity, our well-diversified sources helped to further fortify our balance sheet. As of the end of the first quarter, cash and liquid assets were approximately $1 billion at the holding company, above our $500  ss was solid. SCS sales improved 11% year-over-year. Group Retirement increased inflows by 20%, driven by growth in both first year and renewal premiums. AB had its strongest retail gross sales quarter ever, with over $24 billion.\\nAnd in Protection Solutions, we continued to drive gross premium growth in our Employee Benefit business.

In parallel, we have a deep third-party distribution partner network of over 1,100 firms, with leading positions in key channels, which cannot be quickly replicated.\\nAnd finally, we have leadership scale in resilient segments. We have built scale in focused market segments. We're the number one provider of public sector retirement solutions for kindergarten to 12th grade educators, which we believe is more immune to economic downturns. And as a leader in the retirement market, as the number two variable annuity player, we are well positioned to help people prepare for their next life chapters, especially in these volatile times. While AB, given its global footprint and broad investment offers, provides deep investment expertise. For the discrete month of April, our core activity indicators remain solid.\\nFor Equitable Life, demand for advice remains strong. We've seen a 20% increase in client engagement activities, while new business flows in April are running at roughly 70% of normal levels. Net flows are stable, supported by the reoccurring premium aspect of our business lines.\\nWhile our in-force, which represents 95% of our revenues, has not experienced meaningful outflows. Sadly, we have seen initial COVID-related claims, which through April were approximately $40 million gross before accounting for any offsets. For our subsidiary, AB, we saw positive net flows through April, following first quarter outflows concentrated in March.\\nIn summary, our business remains resilient. Our commercial teams will continue to pivot to ensure we deliver for our clients and communities during this period. With that said, I'd like to hand the call back to Mark for closing comments.\\nMark Pearson -- Chief Executive Officer and President\\nThank you, Nick. Thank you, Anders. Before opening to questions, I'd just like to close by expressing my pride in these results. I'm proud of how the people of Equitable have rallied together during these challenging times.\\nBut most of all, I'm proud of what the team has done over the past decade to build a resilient balance sheet and robust business model, ensuring that Equitable continues to be a force for good, providing American families with advice and solutions to help them secure their financial futures, while providing our shareholders with attractive return on their investments.\\nNow I'd like to hand it back to the operator for questions and answers.\\nQuestions and Answers:\\nOperator\\nCertainly. [Operator Instructions] Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo, your line is open.\\nElyse Greenspan -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\\nHi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question, you mentioned that there was $40 million of losses in April from COVID. Can you just provide a little bit more color on where you're seeing the losses? And how we should think about them hitting your segments? I'm assuming a good chunk would be in Protection. And then just how we should think about modeling that for both April and then going forward for the balance of the year?\\nMark Pearson -- Chief Executive Officer and President\\nThanks for your question, Elyse. Anders, will you deal with that one, please?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. Of course, Mark. Thanks, Elyse. Good morning. So as Nick said, we saw about $40 million gross claims and -- through April. If we take the Fauci scenario, the lower end of the Fauci scenario, about 100,000 tests for the total U.S. and translate with what we know today, there's still a lot of uncertainty. We would probably get to somewhere between $100 million to $130 million net impact then to earnings. That's kind of the range I can give you right now, but there's still a lot of uncertainty around.\\nElyse Greenspan -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\\nOkay. That's helpful. And then my second question, you guys had mentioned in April that new business was around 70% of normal. Just hoping for -- if there's any more color you can give in terms of thinking about new business trends going forward beyond Apri a near zero duration gap despite a regulatory framework that is slow to react to sharp falls in interest rates. And today, still permits reverting to a 3.5% or higher interest rate level.\\nOur resilience comes not from what we've done in the past quarter or what we have done over the past decade. Looking at the first quarter results, a strong quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings per common share amounted to $1.08, up 10% year-over-year, reflecting higher AUM and delivery of our productivity and GA rebalancing strategies.\\nIn Q1 and through the end of April, we are seeing limited adverse experience on COVID-19 mortality and minimal increase in lapses or withdrawals. Recurring premium flows are solid. For April, the first month of significant disruption and social distancing, new business activity across the board was about 70% of normal levels.\\nAs of the quarter end, our AUM across both Equitable and AllianceBernstein, excluding any double count, was $646 billion, down 12% from December 31, 2019. Despite this, we remain on track to meet our stated capitalization, payout ratio and $75 million net savings targets.\\nNow looking forward, the economic outlook is, of course, uncertain, even unknown. We will not be providing today an economic forecast for what is to happen. We don't know. We will, however, reaffirm market sensitivity of our earnings, in line with prior guidance of $150 million per annum for a 10% equity market decline.\\nWe see no advantage in trying to anchor to one scenario. We know, however, it is important today, not only to give comfort about our balance sheet, but also to show you why we believe Equitable's business model is able to adapt to create value across a broad range of future scenarios.\\nWe can adapt and create value for three reasons. Firstly, remember that our large in-force portfolio gives us stability. For the year 2020, 95% of our operating revenues will come from our policies in-force on January the 1st.\\nSecond, there are three features unique about our business model. One, we have a history of developing economically sound products, which are even more in demand today. Consumers' reaction to this virus is translating into higher demand for financial advice and family protection. Obviously, people have heightened awareness of the need to look after their families for known events like retirement and unknown events like pandemics and illnesses.\\nTwo, our affiliated distribution and broad range of third-party partnerships gives us stability and privileged access to end clients. We also benefit from the ability to change our product mix fast.\\nAnd three, we are a trusted leader in resilient sectors. We are the number one provider of retirement solutions to the K through 12 public sector educators market. And our variable annuity products provide added attraction for retirement planners in this volatile environment. We alone can provide a secure income for retirement.\\nOur subsidiary, AllianceBernstein, continues to perform well in its sector and offers us portfolio diversification and nonregulated cash flows. Finally, Equitable has benefited from our recent IPO. The whole process of setting up the company from our risk policy, establishing the initial balance sheet to CTE98 asset levels and putting in place a hedging program no longer reliant on a foreign parent has really caused us to think deeply about how we deliver value to both clients and shareholders.\\nSo despite the significant dislocation, and the uncertain short-term future, I'm confident that our robust business model and the fantastic people who make up this organization means that Equitable will continue as a strong and meaningful player.\\nSo in summary, a truly unprecedented quarter, a pandemic the like of which we have never seen and we certainly never planned for. But what we at Equitable had planned for is total immunization of our balance sheet on falls in interest rates and equity markets, and this has proven extremely valuable.\\nOur hedging program is working as designed, and today, we find ourselves with over $7 billion of liquidity in Prepared Remarks:\\nOperator\\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to Equitable Holdings First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker for today, Jessica Baehr, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\\nJessica Baehr -- Head of Investor Relations\\nThank you. Good morning, and welcome to Equitable Holdings first quarter 2020 earnings call. Materials for today's call can be found on our website at ir.equitableholdings.com.\\nBefore we begin, I would like to note that some of the information we present today is forward-looking and subject to certain SEC rules and regulations regarding disclosure. Our results may materially differ from those expressed in or indicated by such forward-looking statements. So I'd like to point out the Safe Harbor language on Slide 2 of our presentation. You can also find our Safe Harbor language in our 10-Q.\\nJoining me on today's call is Mark Pearson, President and Chief Executive Officer of Equitable Holdings; Anders Malmstrom, our Chief Financial Officer; and Nick Lane, President of Equitable Life. Also on the line is John Weisenseel, AllianceBernstein's Chief Financial Officer.\\nDuring this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures that are not based on generally accepted accounting principles, also known as non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and related definitions may be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website, in our earnings release, slide presentation and financial supplement.\\nI would now like to turn the call over to Mark, Anders and Nick for their prepared remarks.\\nMark Pearson -- Chief Executive Officer and President\\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. It's obviously a difficult time for most people. So first and most importantly, I hope that you and your families are all safe and well.\\nWe're going to try and do three things today. I'm going to give an overview, then Anders will take you through our balance sheet and results; and lastly, Nick will give an update on what we're seeing in April and talk about the robustness of our business model.\\nSo now turning to Slide 3. During this terrible pandemic and its tremendous human and economic challenges, Equitable has a special role to play. It is times like this that we, Equitable, show our role in society.\\nOur purpose is to protect families and secure the financial well-being of our clients, so they can live long and fulfilling lives. And I'm so proud of the ingenuity and commitment of our people in delivering exactly this. 98% of the Equitable workforce is working remotely today. And of course, we are supporting our people with a comprehensive stay well program. They've done a remarkable job at accelerating our digital outreach, launching new planning tools and keeping the highest levels of service and advice to our clients.\\nWe recognize also that we are part of a wider community and that many in society need an extra hand now. Through the Equitable Foundation, we have been providing financial support, particularly geared toward feeding and educating children.\\nToday, we'll talk about earnings for the first quarter, but it's most important now that we cover the strength of our balance sheet and how our business model will fare in these volatile times. Equitable has a resilient balance sheet. Our RBC ratio is approximately 450% to 475%. We have over $1 billion of liquidity at Equitable Holdings and nearly $7 billion at Equitable Life. Our strong position today is the result of a decade-long risk management program. This includes strategies to remove basis risk exposure, pioneering volatility management tools and introducing new categories for products like buffered annuities.\\nAnd at all times, we've maintained a high-quality fixed income portfolio with strong emphasis on diversification. Most importantly, we hedge to our full economic liabilities. This means that we immunize our balance sheet to interest rates. We managed to  unting, is that going to have a depressing impact on baseline earnings from this point forward?\\nI know there's probably some offsetting items there because there's a lower DAC asset, but probably the lower roll-forward of discount rate, I presume would play some pressure on GAAP earnings?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nRight. So maybe first and foremost, I think it's important that we have prudent assumptions in our accounting framework. Even though, I mean, as we said before, we manage to the forward rate.\\nBut the -- GAAP is not a fair value on framework, that's why we -- I think we use a very prudent and interest rate assumption going forward. This is just reflecting reality.\\nNow the biggest impact is really on Protection Solutions because of the accounting change, Protection Solutions falls back into loss recognition. And that makes Protection Solutions more volatile, but I think that's really the key issue.\\nWhat is important here as well, I mean, it really brings us just closer to the FASB target improvement framework, which we support, as you know.\\nThomas Gallagher -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\nOkay. Thanks.\\nOperator\\nSuneet Kamath with Citi, your line is open.\\nSuneet Kamath -- Citi -- Analyst\\nThanks. I wanted to go to the 50% to 60% payout ratio. Just to make sure I heard the prepared remarks correctly. So I think you had said something along the lines of that assumes equity markets are stable to April.\\nSo if we go back to, say, March 31 equity market levels, would you expect an impact on that payout ratio?\\nMark Pearson -- Chief Executive Officer and President\\nHi, Suneet. It's Mark. Let me deal with that one. Yes, as you said, we expect to achieve our target payout ratio for the year, but two conditions. Firstly, as always, that we can maintain strong management of the capital and liquidity, in particular, that we can meet our true economic liabilities.\\nAnd so far, so good there. Our portfolio continues to produce strong cash flows, hedging is working very well. And as you heard from Anders, capital ratios are healthy.\\nAnd secondly, and obviously, we've got off with [Phonetic] somewhat normal economic conditions. And for the past several weeks and certainly back in March time, it certainly wasn't normal conditions, but markets have slowly come back, we've adapted.\\nAnd under current conditions, we should be able to meet our target for 2020 on the payout ratio.\\nSuneet Kamath -- Citi -- Analyst\\nRight. I'm just trying to get a sense of is that -- if we do go back to March 31 equity market levels, how much of an impact could that have on that payout ratio?\\nMark Pearson -- Chief Executive Officer and President\\nI think the only thing we can give you is that sensitivity what we said to earnings, and that is if markets are down 10% for a full year, that would hit earnings by $150 million.\\nYou can make your own assumptions from that.\\nSuneet Kamath -- Citi -- Analyst\\nOkay. And then the second question was on the AB stake. I think, Anders, earlier in the year, you talked about a review of the stake and getting back to investors at some point in 2020. Is that still under way?\\nAnd just curious if the impact of COVID and all the uncertainty that's causing is going to change the timing of any announcement that you guys might make on that?\\nMark Pearson -- Chief Executive Officer and President\\nSuneet, yeah, your memory is correct. We did indeed say that. But as you indicated in your question, I mean, quarter ONE has been really focused on maintaining the strength of the balance sheet; secondly, supporting our people and our clients.\\nAnd then, as Nick outlined, adapting the business model. So I think, as we said before on AB, look, we're comfortable with the 65%. It's our norm. We will get to look at it. But you're right, we haven't done anything in this quarter ONE, it's certainly not our priority.\\nSuneet Kamath -- Citi -- Analyst\\nOkay. Got it. Thank you.\\nMark Pearson -- Chief Executive Officer and President\\nThanks.\\nOperator\\nRyan Krueger with KBW, your line is open.\\nRyan Krueger -- Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods -- Analyst\\nHi. Go driver going forward. So that's what's going to create volatility in the future.\\nJust to remind you now, this volatility will go away under LDTI, the loss recognition framework will change, and we won't be in that framework anymore. But look, it's volatility and volatility is going to be impacted by many things. Mortality is just one of them, but I wouldn't see that as the biggest driver.\\nAlex Scott -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\\nGot it. And maybe if I could ask one last one on dividend timing. I think you guys usually take that out midyear. Any plans to make that more consistent over the course of the year?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah. As we told you, I mean, usually, that's in the June-July framework, that's when we usually take the dividend out and that's normal practice.\\nAlex Scott -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\\nOkay. All right. Thank you.\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nThank you.\\nOperator\\nJimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan, your line is open.\\nJimmy Bhullar -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\\nHi. Good morning. So first, I just had a question on your assumption review, and you took down interest rate assumptions by almost 120 basis points to a fairly conservative level. I'm assuming you're not planning on adjusting again as you go through your annual review process in 3Q. But obviously, as we get to 2022, based on current rates, you'll have to have another adjustment, but should we assume that if you were to bring that down further, the impact on your results would be fairly proportional with what it was or r does it increase or reduce as you go to lower and lower levels?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. So Jimmy, as you said, I mean, we adjusted the assumptions pretty significantly this quarter. And I think we're probably the most conservative company right now when it comes to interest rate assumptions.\\nThe way we do it, we actually take the five-year average of the interest rate curve and take that after long-term assumption and trade it over 10 years. So I don't see too much volatility in that. But you're right, I mean there -- if rates stay where they are, I mean, it has to come down to current levels at the end of the day. So that's what I do.\\nJimmy Bhullar -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\\nYeah. And others will have to come down more. I'm just trying to see if someone were to guess the impact on your results, will it be fairly consistent with what -- like, 100 basis points from [Indecipherable]. If you were to bring it down another 100 basis points, would it be somewhat similar? Or does the impact increase as it declines as the assumption declines to lower and lower levels?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes, I'm not sure it's fully either, you have to differentiate between the Protection Solutions piece and the rest. I think the rest is more linear. Protections Solutions is mainly because you go into loss recognition. So that's rewriting down that. So -- but I think as the first guess, that's what I would do. But we haven't done that or I can't confirm that yet.\\nJimmy Bhullar -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\\nAnd then just on the SCS product, you've had pretty strong growth in that product line over the past one-plus year. But a lot of other companies have come out with similar products. How do you see that affecting your sales once you sort of get to somewhat of a normalized activity later in the year. Do you expect to see weakness in your sales because other companies have similar products or not really?\\nMark Pearson -- Chief Executive Officer and President\\nJimmy, it's Mark. Hi. So we've had competition here for quite a few quarters now. Maybe if I hand to Nick to explain, I mean the answer top line is not just product design, it's distribution. But let's ask Nick to give some color as to the distribution power we've got behind this product.\\nNick Lane -- President of Equitable\\nGreat. Thank you. Yes, as Mark said, look, we've -- we're the innovator of the product. We're the market leader. We've got entrenched distribution, and we believe the product, which provides upside potential and a near zero duration gap despite a regulatory framework that is slow to react to sharp falls in interest rates. And today, still permits reverting to a 3.5% or higher interest rate level.\\nOur resilience comes not from what we've done in the past quarter or what we have done over the past decade. Looking at the first quarter results, a strong quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings per common share amounted to $1.08, up 10% year-over-year, reflecting higher AUM and delivery of our productivity and GA rebalancing strategies.\\nIn Q1 and through the end of April, we are seeing limited adverse experience on COVID-19 mortality and minimal increase in lapses or withdrawals.

We alone can provide a secure income for retirement.\\nOur subsidiary, AllianceBernstein, continues to perform well in its sector and offers us portfolio diversification and nonregulated cash flows. Finally, Equitable has benefited from our recent IPO. The whole process of setting up the company from our risk policy, establishing the initial balance sheet to CTE98 asset levels and putting in place a hedging program no longer reliant on a foreign parent has really caused us to think deeply about how we deliver value to both clients and shareholders.\\nSo despite the significant dislocation, and the uncertain short-term future, I'm confident that our robust business model and the fantastic people who make up this organization means that Equitable will continue as a strong and meaningful player.\\nSo in summary, a truly unprecedented quarter, a pandemic the like of which we have never seen and we certainly never planned for. But what we at Equitable had planned for is total immunization of our balance sheet on falls in interest rates and equity markets, and this has proven extremely valuable.\\nOur hedging program is working as designed, and today, we find ourselves with over $7 billion of liquidity in a near zero duration gap despite a regulatory framework that is slow to react to sharp falls in interest rates. And today, still permits reverting to a 3.5% or higher interest rate level.\\nOur resilience comes not from what we've done in the past quarter or what we have done over the past decade. Looking at the first quarter results, a strong quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings per common share amounted to $1.08, up 10% year-over-year, reflecting higher AUM and delivery of our productivity and GA rebalancing strategies.\\nIn Q1 and through the end of April, we are seeing limited adverse experience on COVID-19 mortality and minimal increase in lapses or withdrawals. Recurring premium flows are solid. For April, the first month of significant disruption and social distancing, new business activity across the board was about 70% of normal levels.\\nAs of the quarter end, our AUM across both Equitable and AllianceBernstein, excluding any double count, was $646 billion, down 12% from December 31, 2019. Despite this, we remain on track to meet our stated capitalization, payout ratio and $75 million net savings targets.\\nNow looking forward, the economic outlook is, of course, uncertain, even unknown. We will not be providing today an economic forecast for what is to happen. We don't know. We will, however, reaffirm market sensitivity of our earnings, in line with prior guidance of $150 million per annum for a 10% equity market decline.\\nWe see no advantage in trying to anchor to one scenario. We know, however, it is important today, not only to give comfort about our balance sheet, but also to show you why we believe Equitable's business model is able to adapt to create value across a broad range of future scenarios.\\nWe can adapt and create value for three reasons. Firstly, remember that our large in-force portfolio gives us stability. For the year 2020, 95% of our operating revenues will come from our policies in-force on January the 1st.\\nSecond, there are three features unique about our business model. One, we have a history of developing economically sound products, which are even more in demand today. Consumers' reaction to this virus is translating into higher demand for financial advice and family protection. Obviously, people have heightened awareness of the need to look after their families for known events like retirement and unknown events like pandemics and illnesses.\\nTwo, our affiliated distribution and broad range of third-party partnerships gives us stability and privileged access to end clients. We also benefit from the ability to change our product mix fast.\\nAnd three, we are a trusted leader in resilient sectors. We are the number one provider of retirement solutions to the K through 12 public sector educators market. And our variable annuity products provide added attraction for retirement planners in this volatile environment. We alone can provide a secure income for retirement.\\nOur subsidiary, AllianceBernstein, continues to perform well in its sector and offers us portfolio diversification and nonregulated cash flows. Finally, Equitable has benefited from our recent IPO. The whole process of setting up the company from our risk policy, establishing the initial balance sheet to CTE98 asset levels and putting in place a hedging program no longer reliant on a foreign parent has really caused us to think deeply about how we deliver value to both clients and shareholders.\\nSo despite the significant dislocation, and the uncertain short-term future, I'm confident that our robust business model and the fantastic people who make up this organization means that Equitable will continue as a strong and meaningful player.\\nSo in summary, a truly unprecedented quarter, a pandemic the like of which we have never seen and we certainly never planned for. But what we at Equitable had planned for is total immunization of our balance sheet on falls in interest rates and equity markets, and this has proven extremely valuable.\\nOur hedging program is working as designed, and today, we find ourselves with over $7 billion of liquidity in l?\\nAnd then can you give us like a rule of thumb, as you write less new business, how much capital that could potentially free up?\\nMark Pearson -- Chief Executive Officer and President\\nElyse, why don't I just set the context? I'll ask Nick just to talk quickly about the segments and then Anders can go. And obviously, it would not be prudent of us at this stage to give any forecast going forward. We -- it's just too much unknown going on.\\nI think the thing to remember is from Nick's comments in there, we're looking at new business. Obviously, it's important over the long term. But in the short term, certainly for 2020, 95% of revenues will come from policies we had in-force at the 1st of January. The book is behaving well. Recurring premiums are strong. We're not seeing any outflows or anything like that. So in the short term, revenues look OK.\\nRunning at about 70%, as Nick said, we think that's absolutely remarkable because this was the first month of social distancing, huge upheaval to how people normally operate. So we're very, very happy with what we're seeing in that first month. And the adaptability and the ability to pivot that Nick spoke about is very, very evident as we say.\\nNick, just give us a little bit of color across the segments, I think that will help.\\nNick Lane -- President of Equitable\\nSure. First, for Individual Retirement, 85% of our sales are coming from product lines like SCS or structured annuity notes. As you saw, we were up 11% last quarter. So we've got confidence given the upside potential and downside protection that it's right for these volatile times.\\nOverall, Equitable advisors, our affiliated sales force continues to give us access directly to clients' needs and their behaviors.\\nSo for IR, we're running at about 70% of total capacity for normal business flows. In the Group Retirement space, the public sector remains immune. Teachers are fully employed and extremely active. They're doing heroic things in distance learning as I can attest with three kids.\\nNot surprisingly, we did see a decline in new teacher applications as we continue to focus on our existing million educators through this period.\\nAnd given, as was mentioned -- given the renewals and recurring nature of our retirement solutions, flows remain solid.\\nOn Protection, we are seeing an enhanced interest in Protection-type products. We have pivoted toward our express underwriting for term and modified our -- some of our policies capping the face amounts that we will provide without bloods and fluids.\\nSo the ranges within that $70 million would be down 50% in certain lines and to about 10%, but it's still unknown.\\nWe continue to focus on our clients. And we believe that given our remote outreach and magnifying our voice that's going to present and position us well to emerge stronger on the other side.\\nAnders, do you want to chip in there?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah. Look, just quickly on your question about the impact from sales on our balance sheet. But as we said before, I mean, the balance sheet is very strong. And I don't think that the sales -- obviously, we monitor the sales, but this will have no impact on the balance sheet in this period.\\nElyse Greenspan -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\\nOkay. Thank you for the color.\\nOperator\\nTom Gallagher with Evercore, your line is open.\\nThomas Gallagher -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\nGood morning. A question on -- Anders, if you're overhedged on the new statutory framework because that's using mean reversion and you're not, shouldn't your RBC ratio have gone up in a quarter where rates plunge like they did?\\nAnd because it didn't, is the difference due to the use of treasuries as part of the hedging program?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. So Tom, look, I think the RBC, as you said, I mean, uses the mean reversion still and going back to 3.5% and we hedge to the forward curve.\\nSo we overhedged statutory on the interest rates. But as you say, we use our treasuries really to hedge about 20%, 25% of it. So it's about $2 billion gains that we have that di driver going forward. So that's what's going to create volatility in the future.\\nJust to remind you now, this volatility will go away under LDTI, the loss recognition framework will change, and we won't be in that framework anymore. But look, it's volatility and volatility is going to be impacted by many things. Mortality is just one of them, but I wouldn't see that as the biggest driver.\\nAlex Scott -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\\nGot it. And maybe if I could ask one last one on dividend timing. I think you guys usually take that out midyear. Any plans to make that more consistent over the course of the year?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah. As we told you, I mean, usually, that's in the June-July framework, that's when we usually take the dividend out and that's normal practice.\\nAlex Scott -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\\nOkay. All right. Thank you.\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nThank you.\\nOperator\\nJimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan, your line is open.\\nJimmy Bhullar -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\\nHi. Good morning. So first, I just had a question on your assumption review, and you took down interest rate assumptions by almost 120 basis points to a fairly conservative level. I'm assuming you're not planning on adjusting again as you go through your annual review process in 3Q. But obviously, as we get to 2022, based on current rates, you'll have to have another adjustment, but should we assume that if you were to bring that down further, the impact on your results would be fairly proportional with what it was or r does it increase or reduce as you go to lower and lower levels?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. So Jimmy, as you said, I mean, we adjusted the assumptions pretty significantly this quarter. And I think we're probably the most conservative company right now when it comes to interest rate assumptions.\\nThe way we do it, we actually take the five-year average of the interest rate curve and take that after long-term assumption and trade it over 10 years. So I don't see too much volatility in that. But you're right, I mean there -- if rates stay where they are, I mean, it has to come down to current levels at the end of the day. So that's what I do.\\nJimmy Bhullar -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\\nYeah. And others will have to come down more. I'm just trying to see if someone were to guess the impact on your results, will it be fairly consistent with what -- like, 100 basis points from [Indecipherable]. If you were to bring it down another 100 basis points, would it be somewhat similar? Or does the impact increase as it declines as the assumption declines to lower and lower levels?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes, I'm not sure it's fully either, you have to differentiate between the Protection Solutions piece and the rest. I think the rest is more linear. Protections Solutions is mainly because you go into loss recognition. So that's rewriting down that. So -- but I think as the first guess, that's what I would do. But we haven't done that or I can't confirm that yet.\\nJimmy Bhullar -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\\nAnd then just on the SCS product, you've had pretty strong growth in that product line over the past one-plus year. But a lot of other companies have come out with similar products. How do you see that affecting your sales once you sort of get to somewhat of a normalized activity later in the year. Do you expect to see weakness in your sales because other companies have similar products or not really?\\nMark Pearson -- Chief Executive Officer and President\\nJimmy, it's Mark. Hi. So we've had competition here for quite a few quarters now. Maybe if I hand to Nick to explain, I mean the answer top line is not just product design, it's distribution. But let's ask Nick to give some color as to the distribution power we've got behind this product.\\nNick Lane -- President of Equitable\\nGreat. Thank you. Yes, as Mark said, look, we've -- we're the innovator of the product. We're the market leader. We've got entrenched distribution, and we believe the product, which provides upside potential and 100% volatility managed funds, enabling 100% hedgeability.\\nIn 2010, we also designed the industry's first buffered annuity, Structured Capital Strategies. Since introducing SCS, we have steadily built diversified distribution partnerships that have proven difficult to replicate. As a result, we continue to have a leading position in the buffered annuity market despite increased competition.\\nAs evident from the actions outlined above, our prudent risk culture has been in place long for our IPO that has served as the foundation for our economic model. Further, we took additional measures to strengthen our balance sheet prior to the IPO, including securing an injection of $2.3 billion from AXA Group and establishing CTE98 as our variable annuity capital standards.\\nIt requires time, fortitude and conviction to achieve this level of organizational transformation. However, we recognize that we are stewards of the business and have a responsibility to deliver on our promises to clients and to optimize value for shareholders. Thanks to the prudent management actions taken over the last decade, we have the utmost confidence in our ability to continue delivering on these promises for the long term.\\nOn Slide 6, I'll just provide a brief summary of our first quarter operating performance. Additional details on a segment and total Company basis can be found in the appendix and in our press release. Overall, we are pleased with how the business performed in the first quarter with non-GAAP operating earnings of $515 million translating to $1.08 per common share, an increase of 10% versus the first quarter of 2019.\\nNet income was $5.4 billion in the quarter, driven primarily by significant hedge gains, which I'll review in deeper detail on the following page. We maintained solid momentum in each of our segments, even as we faced headwinds through the latter third of the quarter.\\nOperating earnings were up at AB and in our Retirement segment, primarily driven by higher fee-type revenues and new business activity across the business was solid. SCS sales improved 11% year-over-year. Group Retirement increased inflows by 20%, driven by growth in both first year and renewal premiums. AB had its strongest retail gross sales quarter ever, with over $24 billion.\\nAnd in Protection Solutions, we continued to drive gross premium growth in our Employee Benefit business. All in all, it was another strong quarter for Equitable. And while the current social and economic environment will certainly present challenges going forward, we are navigating the uncertainty on strong footing, thanks to the resilience of our balance sheet and business model.\\nTurning now to Slide 7. I would like to review the walk from net income to non-GAAP operating earnings. This slide perfectly illustrates the disconnect between the accounting treatment of insurance assets and liabilities under U.S. GAAP. As I previously mentioned, the hedge gains of $12 billion simply reflects an increase in our economic assets to cover our economic liabilities and should not be considered excess cash.\\nIncluded in the first quarter net income results of $5.4 billion were significant noneconomic items related to VA product features, driven by GMxB hedging, realigned interest assumptions and nonperformance risk. In light of the decline in interest rates this quarter, we realigned our long-term GAAP interest rate assumptions to grade from the current spot rate to 2.25% over 10 years, following the five-year historical average for the 10-year treasury.\\nThis change resulted in unfavorable impact to net income of $1.9 billion, more than offset by year-to-date economic interest rate hedge gains of $4.4 billion, resulting in a net impact of approximately $2.4 billion post-tax this quarter.\\nBy reflecting the interest rate accounting impact today, our GAAP financial results move closer to FASB targeted improvement implementation and importantly, more closely aligns with our economic model. Additionally, we saw a significant impact this quarter related to nonperformance risk due to widening credit sprea 100% volatility managed funds, enabling 100% hedgeability.\\nIn 2010, we also designed the industry's first buffered annuity, Structured Capital Strategies.

Additionally, we saw a significant impact this quarter related to nonperformance risk due to widening credit sprea million minimum target.\\nAt our insurance company, cash and liquid assets are nearly $7 billion as a result of hedging to our economic liabilities. This is not distributable capital as it is backing our economic liabilities. Between ongoing quarterly distributions from AllianceBernstein and the annual Life company dividend, we anticipate midyear, we are well positioned to continue generating strong cash flows from our operating entities.\\nOur strong position is further enhanced by the additional liquidity levers we already have in place, including $4.4 billion of credit lines and $1 billion in contingent capital through P-Caps. In the first quarter, we returned $274 million to shareholders, including $69 million to quarterly cash dividend and $205 million of share buyback.\\nIn addition, we intend to increase our quarterly dividend by $0.02 to $0.17 per share payable in the second quarter. As a result of our financial strength and cash flow generation, our capital management program remains on target. Furthermore, if equity markets are sustained at current levels through year-end, we expect to continue to deliver on the 50% to 60% target payout ratio.\\nMoving to our investment portfolio on Page 9. I want to continue to illustrate how our risk management framework has placed us in a strong position to withstand a wide range of adverse and severe credit scenario, while still maintaining a robust capital position. We take a conservative approach to managing our general account, actively managing risk and investing in a diversified mix of high-quality assets.\\nAs of quarter end, over 70% of our portfolio was invested in corporates and treasuries and 98% of our fixed maturities were investment-grade with an average portfolio rating of A2. Our corporate bond portfolio has an average credit rating of A3 and is well diversified across geography and industry, leaving us with a limited exposure to challenged sectors such as energy and transportation.\\nOur commercial mortgage loans are characterized by high-quality collaterals located in major metro areas with well capitalized borrowers, representing approximately 11% of our overall portfolio. We also have limited exposure to alternatives at approximately 2% of our investment portfolio, which are highly diversified across strategies, geographies and vintages.\\nFinally, we have limited investment in structured securities, including approximately 1.5% of CLO exposure and 0% in CMBS. And while we can't know the full depth, magnitude or duration of impact the current crisis will present. We can say that looking at the portfolio through the length of historical high sigma events, we feel confident that we are well prepared.\\nTo illustrate this point, we show here two stress scenarios: one, on our investment portfolio, reflecting default rates and ratings migration observed during the 2008 financial crisis. Leveraging two different methodologies, our analysis estimate that default losses in a 2008-type scenario, assuming no offsetting management actions would result in up to $150 million in losses in the first year and up to $430 million over three years.\\nWhile most industry scenarios assume 2008 stress levels, we thought it's prudent to evaluate a deep stress scenario that assumes impacts that are two times more severe than 2008. Under this deep stress scenario, potential losses would be $300 million in the first year and up to $860 million over three years. While these figures are not insignificant, it's important to contextualize them with respect to the Company's balance sheet, cash flow and earnings power.\\nEvaluating the impact of both defaults and migration on required capital, we estimate a cumulative three-year 77-point impact to our RBC ratio under the stress scenario and 144-point three-year impact under the deep stress scenario. Even assuming no equity market recovery from April levels, we would still expect the business to generate cash flows translating to 60 RBC points in year two and three, totaling an additional 120 RBC points, before dividend to the holdco.\\nGiven our current RBC  driver going forward. So that's what's going to create volatility in the future.\\nJust to remind you now, this volatility will go away under LDTI, the loss recognition framework will change, and we won't be in that framework anymore. But look, it's volatility and volatility is going to be impacted by many things. Mortality is just one of them, but I wouldn't see that as the biggest driver.\\nAlex Scott -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\\nGot it. And maybe if I could ask one last one on dividend timing. I think you guys usually take that out midyear. Any plans to make that more consistent over the course of the year?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah. As we told you, I mean, usually, that's in the June-July framework, that's when we usually take the dividend out and that's normal practice.\\nAlex Scott -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\\nOkay. All right. Thank you.\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nThank you.\\nOperator\\nJimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan, your line is open.\\nJimmy Bhullar -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\\nHi.

Do you expect to see weakness in your sales because other companies have similar products or not really?\\nMark Pearson -- Chief Executive Officer and President\\nJimmy, it's Mark. Hi. So we've had competition here for quite a few quarters now. Maybe if I hand to Nick to explain, I mean the answer top line is not just product design, it's distribution. But let's ask Nick to give some color as to the distribution power we've got behind this product.\\nNick Lane -- President of Equitable\\nGreat. Thank you. Yes, as Mark said, look, we've -- we're the innovator of the product. We're the market leader. We've got entrenched distribution, and we believe the product, which provides upside potential and ds. This measure, which considers our credit risk, impacts the calculation of the estimated fair value of liabilities.\\nFor additional context, should credit spreads narrow, we would expect the opposite impact. To reiterate, this impact during the quarter helped to illustrate precisely why we believe operating earnings is the best proxy for analyzing our performance. As equities sharply declined and interest rates fell in the first quarter, our adjustment was positive, in line with our expectations and previously communicated guidance.\\nFinally, other adjustments to net income this quarter primarily include impacts related to the realignment of GAAP interest rate assumptions in our Protection Solutions and Group Retirement segments and taxes. I would now like to highlight our capital and liquidity position outlined on Slide 8.\\nAs Mark mentioned earlier, the challenging economic environment this quarter has truly allowed us to demonstrate the strength and resiliency of our balance sheet. Last quarter, we announced our new minimum capitalization target of 375% to 400% RBC.\\nThis quarter, despite the S&P falling 20% and U.S. Treasury rates reaching historic lows, we closed the quarter with an RBC ratio of 450% to 475%, continuing to remain well in excess of our minimum target, including CTE98 for VAs. Our hedging target is the economic liability, which assumes the forward curve for interest rates compared to the statutory framework, which relies on a 3.5% reversion to mean assumption. Because we are fully hedged on interest rates, we are overhedged on a statutory basis. This does not imply that we have more excess capital, rather, the increase in assets match the movements in our economic liabilities.\\nAs a result, the interest rate hedge gains protected our RBC during this highly volatile quarter. In terms of liquidity, our well-diversified sources helped to further fortify our balance sheet. As of the end of the first quarter, cash and liquid assets were approximately $1 billion at the holding company, above our $500 million minimum target.\\nAt our insurance company, cash and liquid assets are nearly $7 billion as a result of hedging to our economic liabilities. This is not distributable capital as it is backing our economic liabilities. Between ongoing quarterly distributions from AllianceBernstein and the annual Life company dividend, we anticipate midyear, we are well positioned to continue generating strong cash flows from our operating entities.\\nOur strong position is further enhanced by the additional liquidity levers we already have in place, including $4.4 billion of credit lines and $1 billion in contingent capital through P-Caps. In the first quarter, we returned $274 million to shareholders, including $69 million to quarterly cash dividend and $205 million of share buyback.\\nIn addition, we intend to increase our quarterly dividend by $0.02 to $0.17 per share payable in the second quarter. As a result of our financial strength and cash flow generation, our capital management program remains on target. Furthermore, if equity markets are sustained at current levels through year-end, we expect to continue to deliver on the 50% to 60% target payout ratio.\\nMoving to our investment portfolio on Page 9. I want to continue to illustrate how our risk management framework has placed us in a strong position to withstand a wide range of adverse and severe credit scenario, while still maintaining a robust capital position. We take a conservative approach to managing our general account, actively managing risk and investing in a diversified mix of high-quality assets.\\nAs of quarter end, over 70% of our portfolio was invested in corporates and treasuries and 98% of our fixed maturities were investment-grade with an average portfolio rating of A2. Our corporate bond portfolio has an average credit rating of A3 and is well diversified across geography and industry, leaving us with a limited exposure to challenged sectors such as energy and transportation.\\nOur commercial mortgage loans are characterized by high-quality collaterals loc ated in major metro areas with well capitalized borrowers, representing approximately 11% of our overall portfolio. We also have limited exposure to alternatives at approximately 2% of our investment portfolio, which are highly diversified across strategies, geographies and vintages.\\nFinally, we have limited investment in structured securities, including approximately 1.5% of CLO exposure and 0% in CMBS. And while we can't know the full depth, magnitude or duration of impact the current crisis will present. We can say that looking at the portfolio through the length of historical high sigma events, we feel confident that we are well prepared.\\nTo illustrate this point, we show here two stress scenarios: one, on our investment portfolio, reflecting default rates and ratings migration observed during the 2008 financial crisis. Leveraging two different methodologies, our analysis estimate that default losses in a 2008-type scenario, assuming no offsetting management actions would result in up to $150 million in losses in the first year and up to $430 million over three years.\\nWhile most industry scenarios assume 2008 stress levels, we thought it's prudent to evaluate a deep stress scenario that assumes impacts that are two times more severe than 2008. Under this deep stress scenario, potential losses would be $300 million in the first year and up to $860 million over three years. While these figures are not insignificant, it's important to contextualize them with respect to the Company's balance sheet, cash flow and earnings power.\\nEvaluating the impact of both defaults and migration on required capital, we estimate a cumulative three-year 77-point impact to our RBC ratio under the stress scenario and 144-point three-year impact under the deep stress scenario. Even assuming no equity market recovery from April levels, we would still expect the business to generate cash flows translating to 60 RBC points in year two and three, totaling an additional 120 RBC points, before dividend to the holdco.\\nGiven our current RBC ratio of approximately 450% to 475%, this implies a pro forma RBC of approximately 390% to 520% under this total range of stress scenarios, maintaining our dividend capability and capitalization in excess of the Company's 375% to 400% minimum RBC target.\\nAlso, as a reminder, we were an early adopter of the NAIC VA reform, which utilizes a more conservative RBC calculation referenced here versus those who have not adopted. While we recognize that no two crisis or shocks are the same and that we are certainly not immune to losses, we are defensively positioned, strongly capitalized and well prepared to both protect our balance sheet and capitalize on unique investment opportunities within our risk framework.\\nI will now hand the call over to Nick to shed more light on how the business is operating in the current landscape.\\nNick Lane -- President of Equitable\\nThank you, Anders. As you saw, we had strong momentum in the first quarter, but we now face a very different environment.\\nWe remain steadfast in our focus on three areas outlined here on Page 10: guiding our clients through these volatile times and adapting our businesses to support them; magnifying our outreach to the communities we proudly serve; and as always, taking care of our employees, ensuring they're wealthy.\\nOn the first pillar, we've been pivoting our business processes, leveraging our remote capabilities to serve our clients. Our affiliated sales force with 4,300 advisors nationwide is providing advice directly to roughly 3 million Americans. The health pandemic has generated increased interest in protection products. We have implemented refined COVID-19 underwriting policies, modifying the need for invasive blood and fluid requirements, while deploying new national and state policy guidelines on premium forbearance.\\nOn our second pillar, we're magnifying our outreach to the communities we serve. Americans daily lives have fundamentally changed and we have launched several programs to help. The loss of peace of mind, social connectivity and increased million minimum target.\\nAt our insurance company, cash and liquid assets are nearly $7 billion as a result of hedging to our economic liabilities. This is not distributable capital as it is backing our economic liabilities. Between ongoing quarterly distributions from AllianceBernstein and the annual Life company dividend, we anticipate midyear, we are well positioned to continue generating strong cash flows from our operating entities.\\nOur strong position is further enhanced by the additional liquidity levers we already have in place, including $4.4 billion of credit lines and $1 billion in contingent capital through P-Caps. In the first quarter, we returned $274 million to shareholders, including $69 million to quarterly cash dividend and $205 million of share buyback.\\nIn addition, we intend to increase our quarterly dividend by $0.02 to $0.17 per share payable in the second quarter. As a result of our financial strength and cash flow generation, our capital management program remains on target. Furthermore, if equity markets are sustained at current levels through year-end, we expect to continue to deliver on the 50% to 60% target payout ratio.\\nMoving to our investment portfolio on Page 9. I want to continue to illustrate how our risk management framework has placed us in a strong position to withstand a wide range of adverse and severe credit scenario, while still maintaining a robust capital position. We take a conservative approach to managing our general account, actively managing risk and investing in a diversified mix of high-quality assets.\\nAs of quarter end, over 70% of our portfolio was invested in corporates and treasuries and 98% of our fixed maturities were investment-grade with an average portfolio rating of A2. Our corporate bond portfolio has an average credit rating of A3 and is well diversified across geography and industry, leaving us with a limited exposure to challenged sectors such as energy and transportation.\\nOur commercial mortgage loans are characterized by high-quality collaterals located in major metro areas with well capitalized borrowers, representing approximately 11% of our overall portfolio. We also have limited exposure to alternatives at approximately 2% of our investment portfolio, which are highly diversified across strategies, geographies and vintages.\\nFinally, we have limited investment in structured securities, including approximately 1.5% of CLO exposure and 0% in CMBS. And while we can't know the full depth, magnitude or duration of impact the current crisis will present. We can say that looking at the portfolio through the length of historical high sigma events, we feel confident that we are well prepared.\\nTo illustrate this point, we show here two stress scenarios: one, on our investment portfolio, reflecting default rates and ratings migration observed during the 2008 financial crisis. Leveraging two different methodologies, our analysis estimate that default losses in a 2008-type scenario, assuming no offsetting management actions would result in up to $150 million in losses in the first year and up to $430 million over three years.\\nWhile most industry scenarios assume 2008 stress levels, we thought it's prudent to evaluate a deep stress scenario that assumes impacts that are two times more severe than 2008. Under this deep stress scenario, potential losses would be $300 million in the first year and up to $860 million over three years. While these figures are not insignificant, it's important to contextualize them with respect to the Company's balance sheet, cash flow and earnings power.\\nEvaluating the impact of both defaults and migration on required capital, we estimate a cumulative three-year 77-point impact to our RBC ratio under the stress scenario and 144-point three-year impact under the deep stress scenario. Even assuming no equity market recovery from April levels, we would still expect the business to generate cash flows translating to 60 RBC points in year two and three, totaling an additional 120 RBC points, before dividend to the holdco.\\nGiven our current RBC  x Scott -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\\nHi. Good morning. My question is just on the liquidity position in the operating company. I mean, it sounds like that went up pretty substantially. So I was just interested if you could talk about that and if it's related at all to reallocation, if there's a -- if we should expect sort of a drag on the yield you are earning or if it's kind of incremental assets related to the hedge program, if there's some extra income that will be produced there? Just help us think about that liquidity position and how it will affect things?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes, good morning, Alex. And yes, right, absolutely, since we have the hedging program in place, we had a lot of inflows in March. And so this additional liquidity is really coming from the hedging program. So it's additional liquidity. It's really from the cash settlement of the derivatives.\\nAnd we want to keep that flexibility right now because there's still a lot of uncertainty. That's why we have a much higher cash position than usually. So it is incremental. It's not because we liquidated assets.\\nAlex Scott -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\\nGot it. So no go-forward drag from that?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nRight.\\nAlex Scott -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\\nOkay. And then next question I had is just when I think about loss recognition in Protection and the comments that were made around just increased volatility, which I understand, will that sort of change the way that the COVID-19 impact your financial statement? And what I mean by that is you gave your range in terms of, like, what the incremental claims could be, but is there anything about being in loss recognition and that volatility that occurs from that, that could cause the swings related to the COVID-19 claims to kind of come through in an abnormal way?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah. So as we said, I mean, we have went back into loss recognition. It's really driven by the interest rate assumption change. So that's the main driver going forward. So that's what's going to create volatility in the future.\\nJust to remind you now, this volatility will go away under LDTI, the loss recognition framework will change, and we won't be in that framework anymore. But look, it's volatility and volatility is going to be impacted by many things. Mortality is just one of them, but I wouldn't see that as the biggest driver.\\nAlex Scott -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\\nGot it. And maybe if I could ask one last one on dividend timing. I think you guys usually take that out midyear. Any plans to make that more consistent over the course of the year?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah. As we told you, I mean, usually, that's in the June-July framework, that's when we usually take the dividend out and that's normal practice.\\nAlex Scott -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\\nOkay. All right. Thank you.\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nThank you.\\nOperator\\nJimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan, your line is open.\\nJimmy Bhullar -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\\nHi. Good morning. So first, I just had a question on your assumption review, and you took down interest rate assumptions by almost 120 basis points to a fairly conservative level. I'm assuming you're not planning on adjusting again as you go through your annual review process in 3Q. But obviously, as we get to 2022, based on current rates, you'll have to have another adjustment, but should we assume that if you were to bring that down further, the impact on your results would be fairly proportional with what it was or r does it increase or reduce as you go to lower and lower levels?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. So Jimmy, as you said, I mean, we adjusted the assumptions pretty significantly this quarter. And I think we're probably the most conservative company right now when it comes to interest rate assumptions.\\nThe way we do it, we actually take the five-year average of the interest rate curve and take that after long-term assumption and trade it over 10 years. So I don't see too much vola  our Life company, no reliance on a future reversion to mean interest rate and a business model, which is proving its robustness at a time of extreme disruption.\\nLet me hand over now to Anders to go into more detail. Anders?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nThank you, Mark. Now turning to Slide 4. As Mark discussed, our economic model is the cornerstone of our prudent risk management, protecting our balance sheet from declines in interest rates and equity markets. And this quarter perfectly demonstrated why managing to an economic framework is so critical.\\nThose who follow us have seen elements of this page before. As this slide shows, reversion to mean interest rate assumptions under U.S. GAAP and statutory framework vary across the industry and provide a false sense of security in terms of reserving requirements.\\nOur economic balance sheet is protected from interest rates as we use the forward curve and risk neutral scenarios, including negative rates and do not make predictions about future interest rating.\\nWe are fully hedged and duration matched, ensuring our economic assets match our economic liabilities, protecting our balance sheet and future cash flows. The risk gap and statutory frameworks, both currently rely on reversion to mean assumptions to calculate reserves with some insurers still using long-term rates as high as 5%.\\nThis is completely disconnected from the reality of current rates. The truth is, we simply do not know where interest rates are headed, and we do not believe it is prudent for clients or shareholders to take a position here and expose our balance sheet to unnecessary risk. As you can see on the slide, have we managed to our liabilities under GAAP or STAT, we would have been underhedged to our true economic liability by approximately $7 billion and $2 billion, respectively. Our U.S. GAAP financial results perfectly highlights this disconnect between the accounting treatment and the actual movement of our underlying assets and liabilities.\\nAs we hedge to our economic liabilities, the outsized hedge gains we realized this quarter are not, in fact, real gains, but instead reflects an increase in our economic assets to match our economic liabilities. We believe it is important to move away from reversion to mean standards. And we are strongly advocating for the reforms that move GAAP accounting and statutory basis closer to an economic framework.\\nWe are pleased that FASB target improvements largely addresses the uneconomic accounting mismatch of assets and liabilities and believe implementation will help to make GAAP accounting more transparent for investors and more relevant for the insurance sector.\\nMoving on to Slide 5. Our balance sheet strength and continued resilience is the result of intentional prudent management actions that have taken place over the past decade.\\nIn the midst of last financial crisis, we successfully shifted the risk profile of our in-force and new business. Notably, we were one of the first in the industry to develop our own proprietary volatility managed funds. Through a series of fund actions that increased the passivity and volatility management coverage of our guaranteed assets and eliminated unhedgeable asset classes, we reduced basis risk by between 85% and 90%.\\nHad we not taken these actions, losses would have accrued in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Over the past quarter, our volatility management tools not only protected our balance sheet, they also protected client assets from the severe market decline.\\nAs volatility spiked, our volatility managed funds triggered helping to preserve client assets. Similarly, our asset transfer program also initiated moving guaranteed assets under management into fixed income allocation funds.\\nThe prudent risk management is not a zero-sum game. Challenging times also present opportunities to innovate and emerge stronger as our history demonstrates. Following the last financial crisis, we launched the industry's first floating rate variable annuity return on cornerstone. That was comprised of 100% passive and  ing times.\\nBut most of all, I'm proud of what the team has done over the past decade to build a resilient balance sheet and robust business model, ensuring that Equitable continues to be a force for good, providing American families with advice and solutions to help them secure their financial futures, while providing our shareholders with attractive return on their investments.\\nNow I'd like to hand it back to the operator for questions and answers.\\nQuestions and Answers:\\nOperator\\nCertainly. [Operator Instructions] Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo, your line is open.\\nElyse Greenspan -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\\nHi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question, you mentioned that there was $40 million of losses in April from COVID. Can you just provide a little bit more color on where you're seeing the losses? And how we should think about them hitting your segments? I'm assuming a good chunk would be in Protection. And then just how we should think about modeling that for both April and then going forward for the balance of the year?\\nMark Pearson -- Chief Executive Officer and President\\nThanks for your question, Elyse. Anders, will you deal with that one, please?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. Of course, Mark. Thanks, Elyse. Good morning. So as Nick said, we saw about $40 million gross claims and -- through April. If we take the Fauci scenario, the lower end of the Fauci scenario, about 100,000 tests for the total U.S. and translate with what we know today, there's still a lot of uncertainty. We would probably get to somewhere between $100 million to $130 million net impact then to earnings. That's kind of the range I can give you right now, but there's still a lot of uncertainty around.\\nElyse Greenspan -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\\nOkay. That's helpful. And then my second question, you guys had mentioned in April that new business was around 70% of normal. Just hoping for -- if there's any more color you can give in terms of thinking about new business trends going forward beyond April?\\nAnd then can you give us like a rule of thumb, as you write less new business, how much capital that could potentially free up?\\nMark Pearson -- Chief Executive Officer and President\\nElyse, why don't I just set the context? I'll ask Nick just to talk quickly about the segments and then Anders can go. And obviously, it would not be prudent of us at this stage to give any forecast going forward. We -- it's just too much unknown going on.\\nI think the thing to remember is from Nick's comments in there, we're looking at new business. Obviously, it's important over the long term. But in the short term, certainly for 2020, 95% of revenues will come from policies we had in-force at the 1st of January. The book is behaving well. Recurring premiums are strong. We're not seeing any outflows or anything like that. So in the short term, revenues look OK.\\nRunning at about 70%, as Nick said, we think that's absolutely remarkable because this was the first month of social distancing, huge upheaval to how people normally operate. So we're very, very happy with what we're seeing in that first month. And the adaptability and the ability to pivot that Nick spoke about is very, very evident as we say.\\nNick, just give us a little bit of color across the segments, I think that will help.\\nNick Lane -- President of Equitable\\nSure. First, for Individual Retirement, 85% of our sales are coming from product lines like SCS or structured annuity notes. As you saw, we were up 11% last quarter. So we've got confidence given the upside potential and downside protection that it's right for these volatile times.\\nOverall, Equitable advisors, our affiliated sales force continues to give us access directly to clients' needs and their behaviors.\\nSo for IR, we're running at about 70% of total capacity for normal business flows. In the Group Retirement space, the public sector remains immune. Teachers are fully employed and extremely active. They're doing heroic things in distance learning as I can attest with three kids.\\nNot surprisingly, we did see  x Scott -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\\nHi. Good morning. My question is just on the liquidity position in the operating company. I mean, it sounds like that went up pretty substantially. So I was just interested if you could talk about that and if it's related at all to reallocation, if there's a -- if we should expect sort of a drag on the yield you are earning or if it's kind of incremental assets related to the hedge program, if there's some extra income that will be produced there?

So I don't see too much vola then Anders will take you through our balance sheet and results; and lastly, Nick will give an update on what we're seeing in April and talk about the robustness of our business model.\\nSo now turning to Slide 3. During this terrible pandemic and its tremendous human and economic challenges, Equitable has a special role to play. It is times like this that we, Equitable, show our role in society.\\nOur purpose is to protect families and secure the financial well-being of our clients, so they can live long and fulfilling lives. And I'm so proud of the ingenuity and commitment of our people in delivering exactly this. 98% of the Equitable workforce is working remotely today. And of course, we are supporting our people with a comprehensive stay well program. They've done a remarkable job at accelerating our digital outreach, launching new planning tools and keeping the highest levels of service and advice to our clients.\\nWe recognize also that we are part of a wider community and that many in society need an extra hand now. Through the Equitable Foundation, we have been providing financial support, particularly geared toward feeding and educating children.\\nToday, we'll talk about earnings for the first quarter, but it's most important now that we cover the strength of our balance sheet and how our business model will fare in these volatile times. Equitable has a resilient balance sheet. Our RBC ratio is approximately 450% to 475%. We have over $1 billion of liquidity at Equitable Holdings and nearly $7 billion at Equitable Life. Our strong position today is the result of a decade-long risk management program. This includes strategies to remove basis risk exposure, pioneering volatility management tools and introducing new categories for products like buffered annuities.\\nAnd at all times, we've maintained a high-quality fixed income portfolio with strong emphasis on diversification. Most importantly, we hedge to our full economic liabilities. This means that we immunize our balance sheet to interest rates. We managed to a near zero duration gap despite a regulatory framework that is slow to react to sharp falls in interest rates. And today, still permits reverting to a 3.5% or higher interest rate level.\\nOur resilience comes not from what we've done in the past quarter or what we have done over the past decade. Looking at the first quarter results, a strong quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings per common share amounted to $1.08, up 10% year-over-year, reflecting higher AUM and delivery of our productivity and GA rebalancing strategies.\\nIn Q1 and through the end of April, we are seeing limited adverse experience on COVID-19 mortality and minimal increase in lapses or withdrawals. Recurring premium flows are solid. For April, the first month of significant disruption and social distancing, new business activity across the board was about 70% of normal levels.\\nAs of the quarter end, our AUM across both Equitable and AllianceBernstein, excluding any double count, was $646 billion, down 12% from December 31, 2019. Despite this, we remain on track to meet our stated capitalization, payout ratio and $75 million net savings targets.\\nNow looking forward, the economic outlook is, of course, uncertain, even unknown. We will not be providing today an economic forecast for what is to happen. We don't know. We will, however, reaffirm market sensitivity of our earnings, in line with prior guidance of $150 million per annum for a 10% equity market decline.\\nWe see no advantage in trying to anchor to one scenario. We know, however, it is important today, not only to give comfort about our balance sheet, but also to show you why we believe Equitable's business model is able to adapt to create value across a broad range of future scenarios.\\nWe can adapt and create value for three reasons. Firstly, remember that our large in-force portfolio gives us stability. For the year 2020, 95% of our operating revenues will come from our policies in-force on January the 1st.\\nSecond, there are three features unique about our business model. One, we have a histo ratio of approximately 450% to 475%, this implies a pro forma RBC of approximately 390% to 520% under this total range of stress scenarios, maintaining our dividend capability and capitalization in excess of the Company's 375% to 400% minimum RBC target.\\nAlso, as a reminder, we were an early adopter of the NAIC VA reform, which utilizes a more conservative RBC calculation referenced here versus those who have not adopted. While we recognize that no two crisis or shocks are the same and that we are certainly not immune to losses, we are defensively positioned, strongly capitalized and well prepared to both protect our balance sheet and capitalize on unique investment opportunities within our risk framework.\\nI will now hand the call over to Nick to shed more light on how the business is operating in the current landscape.\\nNick Lane -- President of Equitable\\nThank you, Anders. As you saw, we had strong momentum in the first quarter, but we now face a very different environment.\\nWe remain steadfast in our focus on three areas outlined here on Page 10: guiding our clients through these volatile times and adapting our businesses to support them; magnifying our outreach to the communities we proudly serve; and as always, taking care of our employees, ensuring they're wealthy.\\nOn the first pillar, we've been pivoting our business processes, leveraging our remote capabilities to serve our clients.

We have implemented refined COVID-19 underwriting policies, modifying the need for invasive blood and fluid requirements, while deploying new national and state policy guidelines on premium forbearance.\\nOn our second pillar, we're magnifying our outreach to the communities we serve. Americans daily lives have fundamentally changed and we have launched several programs to help. The loss of peace of mind, social connectivity and increased family demands are taking a toll on people's mental well being. Through efforts such as our plan what you can program, we are helping people pull through this difficult period by planning new norms and rituals.\\nIn addition, as a firm, we are active in direct relief efforts, donating supplies to local medical facilities and committing $1 million to help community activities, which keep kids learning, feed the hungry and support center for disease control activities.\\nFinally, ensuring our employees can deliver on our mission while remaining safe is a critical priority. We see advisors and clients working remotely using our full suite of digital engagement, processing and servicing tools to ensure access to their financial assets, awareness of the policy benefits and relief actions.\\nWe expect this digital amplification to open up new opportunities for the future. As Mark mentioned, this is when our mission to help Americans secure long and fulfilling lives comes to the forefront. And I'm very proud of the way our teams have responded.\\nOur business model remains robust and adaptable, driven by the three factors outlined here on Page 11. First, our products remain profitable and in demand. Over the past decade, innovation in designing resilient products anchored in economic realities has been at our core.\\nToday, we are the market leader of structured annuities, providing upside potential and downside protection, helping clients in these volatile markets. While on the protection side, we have a robust product portfolio, focused on capital-light sectors like VUL to address enhanced mortality concerns.\\nAs Anders highlighted, we have been a pioneer in taking meaningful product and in-force actions, drive better risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders and clients. Next, our distribution size and breadth provides privileged ways to access clients. Equitable advisors or affiliated sales force gives us direct access to end client needs and behaviors.\\nThrough many volatile times, it has provided stable, profitable growth a  our Life company, no reliance on a future reversion to mean interest rate and a business model, which is proving its robustness at a time of extreme disruption.\\nLet me hand over now to Anders to go into more detail.

That was comprised of 100% passive and 100% volatility managed funds, enabling 100% hedgeability.\\nIn 2010, we also designed the industry's first buffered annuity, Structured Capital Strategies. Since introducing SCS, we have steadily built diversified distribution partnerships that have proven difficult to replicate. As a result, we continue to have a leading position in the buffered annuity market despite increased competition.\\nAs evident from the actions outlined above, our prudent risk culture has been in place long for our IPO that has served as the foundation for our economic model. Further, we took additional measures to strengthen our balance sheet prior to the IPO, including securing an injection of $2.3 billion from AXA Group and establishing CTE98 as our variable annuity capital standards.\\nIt requires time, fortitude and conviction to achieve this level of organizational transformation. However, we recognize that we are stewards of the business and have a responsibility to deliver on our promises to clients and to optimize value for shareholders. Thanks to the prudent management actions taken over the last decade, we have the utmost confidence in our ability to continue delivering on these promises for the long term.\\nOn Slide 6, I'll just provide a brief summary of our first quarter operating performance. Additional details on a segment and total Company basis can be found in the appendix and in our press release. Overall, we are pleased with how the business performed in the first quarter with non-GAAP operating earnings of $515 million translating to $1.08 per common share, an increase of 10% versus the first quarter of 2019.\\nNet income was $5.4 billion in the quarter, driven primarily by significant hedge gains, which I'll review in deeper detail on the following page. We maintained solid momentum in each of our segments, even as we faced headwinds through the latter third of the quarter.\\nOperating earnings were up at AB and in our Retirement segment, primarily driven by higher fee-type revenues and new business activity across the busine  family demands are taking a toll on people's mental well being. Through efforts such as our plan what you can program, we are helping people pull through this difficult period by planning new norms and rituals.\\nIn addition, as a firm, we are active in direct relief efforts, donating supplies to local medical facilities and committing $1 million to help community activities, which keep kids learning, feed the hungry and support center for disease control activities.\\nFinally, ensuring our employees can deliver on our mission while remaining safe is a critical priority. We see advisors and clients working remotely using our full suite of digital engagement, processing and servicing tools to ensure access to their financial assets, awareness of the policy benefits and relief actions.\\nWe expect this digital amplification to open up new opportunities for the future. As Mark mentioned, this is when our mission to help Americans secure long and fulfilling lives comes to the forefront. And I'm very proud of the way our teams have responded.\\nOur business model remains robust and adaptable, driven by the three factors outlined here on Page 11. First, our products remain profitable and in demand. Over the past decade, innovation in designing resilient products anchored in economic realities has been at our core.\\nToday, we are the market leader of structured annuities, providing upside potential and downside protection, helping clients in these volatile markets. While on the protection side, we have a robust product portfolio, focused on capital-light sectors like VUL to address enhanced mortality concerns.\\nAs Anders highlighted, we have been a pioneer in taking meaningful product and in-force actions, drive better risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders and clients. Next, our distribution size and breadth provides privileged ways to access clients. Equitable advisors or affiliated sales force gives us direct access to end client needs and behaviors.\\nThrough many volatile times, it has provided stable, profitable growth as an anchor tenant in driving new commercial solutions and pivoting our product mix. In parallel, we have a deep third-party distribution partner network of over 1,100 firms, with leading positions in key channels, which cannot be quickly replicated.\\nAnd finally, we have leadership scale in resilient segments. We have built scale in focused market segments. We're the number one provider of public sector retirement solutions for kindergarten to 12th grade educators, which we believe is more immune to economic downturns. And as a leader in the retirement market, as the number two variable annuity player, we are well positioned to help people prepare for their next life chapters, especially in these volatile times. While AB, given its global footprint and broad investment offers, provides deep investment expertise. For the discrete month of April, our core activity indicators remain solid.\\nFor Equitable Life, demand for advice remains strong. We've seen a 20% increase in client engagement activities, while new business flows in April are running at roughly 70% of normal levels. Net flows are stable, supported by the reoccurring premium aspect of our business lines.\\nWhile our in-force, which represents 95% of our revenues, has not experienced meaningful outflows. Sadly, we have seen initial COVID-related claims, which through April were approximately $40 million gross before accounting for any offsets. For our subsidiary, AB, we saw positive net flows through April, following first quarter outflows concentrated in March.\\nIn summary, our business remains resilient. Our commercial teams will continue to pivot to ensure we deliver for our clients and communities during this period. With that said, I'd like to hand the call back to Mark for closing comments.\\nMark Pearson -- Chief Executive Officer and President\\nThank you, Nick. Thank you, Anders. Before opening to questions, I'd just like to close by expressing my pride in these results. I'm proud of how the people of Equitable have rallied together during these challeng ities, the outsized hedge gains we realized this quarter are not, in fact, real gains, but instead reflects an increase in our economic assets to match our economic liabilities. We believe it is important to move away from reversion to mean standards. And we are strongly advocating for the reforms that move GAAP accounting and statutory basis closer to an economic framework.\\nWe are pleased that FASB target improvements largely addresses the uneconomic accounting mismatch of assets and liabilities and believe implementation will help to make GAAP accounting more transparent for investors and more relevant for the insurance sector.\\nMoving on to Slide 5. Our balance sheet strength and continued resilience is the result of intentional prudent management actions that have taken place over the past decade.\\nIn the midst of last financial crisis, we successfully shifted the risk profile of our in-force and new business. Notably, we were one of the first in the industry to develop our own proprietary volatility managed funds. Through a series of fund actions that increased the passivity and volatility management coverage of our guaranteed assets and eliminated unhedgeable asset classes, we reduced basis risk by between 85% and 90%.\\nHad we not taken these actions, losses would have accrued in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Over the past quarter, our volatility management tools not only protected our balance sheet, they also protected client assets from the severe market decline.\\nAs volatility spiked, our volatility managed funds triggered helping to preserve client assets. Similarly, our asset transfer program also initiated moving guaranteed assets under management into fixed income allocation funds.\\nThe prudent risk management is not a zero-sum game. Challenging times also present opportunities to innovate and emerge stronger as our history demonstrates. Following the last financial crisis, we launched the industry's first floating rate variable annuity return on cornerstone.

We maintained solid momentum in each of our segments, even as we faced headwinds through the latter third of the quarter.\\nOperating earnings were up at AB and in our Retirement segment, primarily driven by higher fee-type revenues and new business activity across the busine ated in major metro areas with well capitalized borrowers, representing approximately 11% of our overall portfolio. We also have limited exposure to alternatives at approximately 2% of our investment portfolio, which are highly diversified across strategies, geographies and vintages.\\nFinally, we have limited investment in structured securities, including approximately 1.5% of CLO exposure and 0% in CMBS. And while we can't know the full depth, magnitude or duration of impact the current crisis will present. We can say that looking at the portfolio through the length of historical high sigma events, we feel confident that we are well prepared.\\nTo illustrate this point, we show here two stress scenarios: one, on our investment portfolio, reflecting default rates and ratings migration observed during the 2008 financial crisis. Leveraging two different methodologies, our analysis estimate that default losses in a 2008-type scenario, assuming no offsetting management actions would result in up to $150 million in losses in the first year and up to $430 million over three years.\\nWhile most industry scenarios assume 2008 stress levels, we thought it's prudent to evaluate a deep stress scenario that assumes impacts that are two times more severe than 2008. Under this deep stress scenario, potential losses would be $300 million in the first year and up to $860 million over three years. While these figures are not insignificant, it's important to contextualize them with respect to the Company's balance sheet, cash flow and earnings power.\\nEvaluating the impact of both defaults and migration on required capital, we estimate a cumulative three-year 77-point impact to our RBC ratio under the stress scenario and 144-point three-year impact under the deep stress scenario. Even assuming no equity market recovery from April levels, we would still expect the business to generate cash flows translating to 60 RBC points in year two and three, totaling an additional 120 RBC points, before dividend to the holdco.\\nGiven our current RBC ratio of approximately 450% to 475%, this implies a pro forma RBC of approximately 390% to 520% under this total range of stress scenarios, maintaining our dividend capability and capitalization in excess of the Company's 375% to 400% minimum RBC target.\\nAlso, as a reminder, we were an early adopter of the NAIC VA reform, which utilizes a more conservative RBC calculation referenced here versus those who have not adopted. While we recognize that no two crisis or shocks are the same and that we are certainly not immune to losses, we are defensively positioned, strongly capitalized and well prepared to both protect our balance sheet and capitalize on unique investment opportunities within our risk framework.\\nI will now hand the call over to Nick to shed more light on how the business is operating in the current landscape.\\nNick Lane -- President of Equitable\\nThank you, Anders. As you saw, we had strong momentum in the first quarter, but we now face a very different environment.\\nWe remain steadfast in our focus on three areas outlined here on Page 10: guiding our clients through these volatile times and adapting our businesses to support them; magnifying our outreach to the communities we proudly serve; and as always, taking care of our employees, ensuring they're wealthy.\\nOn the first pillar, we've been pivoting our business processes, leveraging our remote capabilities to serve our clients. Our affiliated sales force with 4,300 advisors nationwide is providing advice directly to roughly 3 million Americans. The health pandemic has generated increased interest in protection products. We have implemented refined COVID-19 underwriting policies, modifying the need for invasive blood and fluid requirements, while deploying new national and state policy guidelines on premium forbearance.\\nOn our second pillar, we're magnifying our outreach to the communities we serve. Americans daily lives have fundamentally changed and we have launched several programs to help. The loss of peace of mind, social connectivity and increased l ratios are healthy.\\nAnd secondly, and obviously, we've got off with [Phonetic] somewhat normal economic conditions. And for the past several weeks and certainly back in March time, it certainly wasn't normal conditions, but markets have slowly come back, we've adapted.\\nAnd under current conditions, we should be able to meet our target for 2020 on the payout ratio.\\nSuneet Kamath -- Citi -- Analyst\\nRight. I'm just trying to get a sense of is that -- if we do go back to March 31 equity market levels, how much of an impact could that have on that payout ratio?\\nMark Pearson -- Chief Executive Officer and President\\nI think the only thing we can give you is that sensitivity what we said to earnings, and that is if markets are down 10% for a full year, that would hit earnings by $150 million.\\nYou can make your own assumptions from that.\\nSuneet Kamath -- Citi -- Analyst\\nOkay. And then the second question was on the AB stake. I think, Anders, earlier in the year, you talked about a review of the stake and getting back to investors at some point in 2020. Is that still under way?\\nAnd just curious if the impact of COVID and all the uncertainty that's causing is going to change the timing of any announcement that you guys might make on that?\\nMark Pearson -- Chief Executive Officer and President\\nSuneet, yeah, your memory is correct. We did indeed say that. But as you indicated in your question, I mean, quarter ONE has been really focused on maintaining the strength of the balance sheet; secondly, supporting our people and our clients.\\nAnd then, as Nick outlined, adapting the business model. So I think, as we said before on AB, look, we're comfortable with the 65%. It's our norm. We will get to look at it. But you're right, we haven't done anything in this quarter ONE, it's certainly not our priority.\\nSuneet Kamath -- Citi -- Analyst\\nOkay. Got it. Thank you.\\nMark Pearson -- Chief Executive Officer and President\\nThanks.\\nOperator\\nRyan Krueger with KBW, your line is open.\\nRyan Krueger -- Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods -- Analyst\\nHi. Good morning. Anders, you mentioned that you're advocating for the NAIC to change the mean reversion interest rate assumptions under STAT. I guess, can you just give us any update on if you think there's a chance that, that would happen and that they do kind of change the current methodology?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah, I would love to do so, Ryan. Good morning. But then I think this is outside of my range to predict and what regulators are doing.\\nBut look, again, I think what we just advocate here making sure that we appropriately evaluate our liabilities and make sure that on both sides of the balance sheet we have a fair value approach. I think that's the only way we have a fair representation of our liabilities, and we can actually manage our liabilities and going forward. And that's really what we're advocating for, is it under STAT? Is it under GAAP? And that's why we use our economic model, which is a full fair value model.\\nBut I cannot predict what the regulators are doing, I can just advocate in one direction.\\nRyan Krueger -- Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods -- Analyst\\nGot it. And then on the $100 million to $130 million potential COVID claims for 100,000 deaths, it seems kind of high. I guess, is that because you have a higher market share in the New York Metro Area and you adjusted the estimate to account for that?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nNo. What we did, Ryan, is really we just took the current data that we see coming out of this end of April. So -- and we just try to link that back to our portfolio. It is very hard right now to do that because there's many factors that have to go in here. It's the age. It's the region. It's the social environment people live in.\\nSo that's why we give this range. I feel confident with the range, but I -- look, I tell you, this is a lot of uncertainty here that's why we gave you that range.\\nRyan Krueger -- Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods -- Analyst\\nThank you.\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions]\\nAlex Scott with Goldman Sachs, your line is open.\\nAle  downside protection is really an asset during these volatile times.\\nJimmy Bhullar -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\\nOkay. Thanks you.\\nOperator\\n[Operator Closing Remarks]\\nDuration: 57 minutes\\nCall participants:\\nJessica Baehr -- Head of Investor Relations\\nMark Pearson -- Chief Executive Officer and President\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nNick Lane -- President of Equitable\\nElyse Greenspan -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\\nThomas Gallagher -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\nSuneet Kamath -- Citi -- Analyst\\nRyan Krueger -- Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods -- Analyst\\nAlex Scott -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\\nJimmy Bhullar -- J.P.

Consumers' reaction to this virus is translating into higher demand for financial advice and family protection. Obviously, people have heightened awareness of the need to look after their families for known events like retirement and unknown events like pandemics and illnesses.\\nTwo, our affiliated distribution and broad range of third-party partnerships gives us stability and privileged access to end clients. We also benefit from the ability to change our product mix fast.\\nAnd three, we are a trusted leader in resilient sectors. We are the number one provider of retirement solutions to the K through 12 public sector educators market. And our variable annuity products provide added attraction for retirement planners in this volatile environment. We alone can provide a secure income for retirement.\\nOur subsidiary, AllianceBernstein, continues to perform well in its sector and offers us portfolio diversification and nonregulated cash flows. Finally, Equitable has benefited from our recent IPO. The whole process of setting up the company from our risk policy, establishing the initial balance sheet to CTE98 asset levels and putting in place a hedging program no longer reliant on a foreign parent has really caused us to think deeply about how we deliver value to both clients and shareholders.\\nSo despite the significant dislocation, and the uncertain short-term future, I'm confident that our robust business model and the fantastic people who make up this organization means that Equitable will continue as a strong and meaningful player.\\nSo in summary, a truly unprecedented quarter, a pandemic the like of which we have never seen and we certainly never planned for. But what we at Equitable had planned for is total immunization of our balance sheet on falls in interest rates and equity markets, and this has proven extremely valuable.\\nOur hedging program is working as designed, and today, we find ourselves with over $7 billion of liquidity in our Life company, no reliance on a future reversion to mean interest rate and a business model, which is proving its robustness at a time of extreme disruption.\\nLet me hand over now to Anders to go into more detail. Anders?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nThank you, Mark. Now turning to Slide 4. As Mark discussed, our economic model is the cornerstone of our prudent risk management, protecting our balance sheet from declines in interest rates and equity markets. And this quarter perfectly demonstrated why managing to an economic framework is so critical.\\nThose who follow us have seen elements of this page before. As this slide shows, reversion to mean interest rate assumptions under U.S. GAAP and statutory framework vary across the industry and provide a false sense of security in terms of reserving requirements.\\nOur economic balance sheet is protected from interest rates as we use the forward curve and risk neutral scenarios, including negative rates and do not make predictions about future interest rating.\\nWe are fully hedged and duration matched, ensuring our economic assets match our economic liabilities, protecting our balance sheet and future cash flows. The risk gap and statutory frameworks, both currently rely on reversion to mean assumptions to calculate reserves with some insurers still using long-term rates as high as 5%.\\nThis is completely disconnected from the reality of current rates. The truth is, we simply do not know where interest rates are headed, and we do not believe it is prudent for clients or shareholders to take a position here and expose our balance sheet to unnecessary risk. As you can see on the slide, have we managed to our liabilities under GAAP or STAT, we would have been underhedged to our true economic liability by approximately $7 billion and $2 billion, respectively. Our U.S. GAAP financial results perfectly highlights this disconnect between the accounting treatment and the actual movement of our underlying assets and liabilities.\\nAs we hedge to our economic liabil ated in major metro areas with well capitalized borrowers, representing approximately 11% of our overall portfolio. We also have limited exposure to alternatives at approximately 2% of our investment portfolio, which are highly diversified across strategies, geographies and vintages.\\nFinally, we have limited investment in structured securities, including approximately 1.5% of CLO exposure and 0% in CMBS. And while we can't know the full depth, magnitude or duration of impact the current crisis will present. We can say that looking at the portfolio through the length of historical high sigma events, we feel confident that we are well prepared.\\nTo illustrate this point, we show here two stress scenarios: one, on our investment portfolio, reflecting default rates and ratings migration observed during the 2008 financial crisis. Leveraging two different methodologies, our analysis estimate that default losses in a 2008-type scenario, assuming no offsetting management actions would result in up to $150 million in losses in the first year and up to $430 million over three years.\\nWhile most industry scenarios assume 2008 stress levels, we thought it's prudent to evaluate a deep stress scenario that assumes impacts that are two times more severe than 2008. Under this deep stress scenario, potential losses would be $300 million in the first year and up to $860 million over three years. While these figures are not insignificant, it's important to contextualize them with respect to the Company's balance sheet, cash flow and earnings power.\\nEvaluating the impact of both defaults and migration on required capital, we estimate a cumulative three-year 77-point impact to our RBC ratio under the stress scenario and 144-point three-year impact under the deep stress scenario. Even assuming no equity market recovery from April levels, we would still expect the business to generate cash flows translating to 60 RBC points in year two and three, totaling an additional 120 RBC points, before dividend to the holdco.\\nGiven our current RBC ratio of approximately 450% to 475%, this implies a pro forma RBC of approximately 390% to 520% under this total range of stress scenarios, maintaining our dividend capability and capitalization in excess of the Company's 375% to 400% minimum RBC target.\\nAlso, as a reminder, we were an early adopter of the NAIC VA reform, which utilizes a more conservative RBC calculation referenced here versus those who have not adopted.

As you saw, we had strong momentum in the first quarter, but we now face a very different environment.\\nWe remain steadfast in our focus on three areas outlined here on Page 10: guiding our clients through these volatile times and adapting our businesses to support them; magnifying our outreach to the communities we proudly serve; and as always, taking care of our employees, ensuring they're wealthy.\\nOn the first pillar, we've been pivoting our business processes, leveraging our remote capabilities to serve our clients.

We have implemented refined COVID-19 underwriting policies, modifying the need for invasive blood and fluid requirements, while deploying new national and state policy guidelines on premium forbearance.\\nOn our second pillar, we're magnifying our outreach to the communities we serve. Americans daily lives have fundamentally changed and we have launched several programs to help. The loss of peace of mind, social connectivity and increased a decline in new teacher applications as we continue to focus on our existing million educators through this period.\\nAnd given, as was mentioned -- given the renewals and recurring nature of our retirement solutions, flows remain solid.\\nOn Protection, we are seeing an enhanced interest in Protection-type products. We have pivoted toward our express underwriting for term and modified our -- some of our policies capping the face amounts that we will provide without bloods and fluids.\\nSo the ranges within that $70 million would be down 50% in certain lines and to about 10%, but it's still unknown.\\nWe continue to focus on our clients. And we believe that given our remote outreach and magnifying our voice that's going to present and position us well to emerge stronger on the other side.\\nAnders, do you want to chip in there?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah. Look, just quickly on your question about the impact from sales on our balance sheet. But as we said before, I mean, the balance sheet is very strong. And I don't think that the sales -- obviously, we monitor the sales, but this will have no impact on the balance sheet in this period.\\nElyse Greenspan -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\\nOkay. Thank you for the color.\\nOperator\\nTom Gallagher with Evercore, your line is open.\\nThomas Gallagher -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\nGood morning. A question on -- Anders, if you're overhedged on the new statutory framework because that's using mean reversion and you're not, shouldn't your RBC ratio have gone up in a quarter where rates plunge like they did?\\nAnd because it didn't, is the difference due to the use of treasuries as part of the hedging program?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. So Tom, look, I think the RBC, as you said, I mean, uses the mean reversion still and going back to 3.5% and we hedge to the forward curve.\\nSo we overhedged statutory on the interest rates. But as you say, we use our treasuries really to hedge about 20%, 25% of it. So it's about $2 billion gains that we have that didn't flow through the statutory and P&L. So it didn't flow through the RBC.\\nAnd then as you know, I mean, you don't hedge the base products. So we have exposure on the base fee. So that's why overall, I think, the balance sheet is very strong on RBC and it doesn't reflect the hedges that go through the general account.\\nThomas Gallagher -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\nThat makes sense. So what would happen if rates continue to go down and it negatively impacted your RBC, would the plan be to sell and rebuy treasury securities to book the gain or how should I think about that?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nSo first of all, I mean, as we said, we hedge to the economic liabilities and I think that's foremost, that's our target. And then I said a portion goes through the general account. So I don't expect that this will change. I think that's a very strong hedge we have. I don't give you the projections on RBC, but I can guarantee you that we manage that to make sure that we are above our target.\\nThomas Gallagher -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\nGot it. And I know New York has implemented their own variable annuity standards. Just in light of what they've announced, are you still confident in getting dividends out of your New York subsidiary on a consistent basis despite that rule change? Thanks.\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah, right. Look, as we discussed during the last call a quarter ago, I mean, New York has this new rollout. It's a New York floor. We discussed at that time as well that I think in the short term, it's not that impactful, but it will -- it can become problematic, in particular, if markets go up.\\nRight now, I think it's the opposite. So we feel very confident in the short term. But it's something we have to work with New York and to make sure that we have sustainable dividend even in the long term.\\nThomas Gallagher -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\nOkay. Thanks. And then just if I could sneak one more in. The -- regarding your reduction in future interest rate assumptions for GAAP acco  downside protection is really an asset during these volatile times.\\nJimmy Bhullar -- J.P.

Thanks to the prudent management actions taken over the last decade, we have the utmost confidence in our ability to continue delivering on these promises for the long term.\\nOn Slide 6, I'll just provide a brief summary of our first quarter operating performance. Additional details on a segment and total Company basis can be found in the appendix and in our press release. Overall, we are pleased with how the business performed in the first quarter with non-GAAP operating earnings of $515 million translating to $1.08 per common share, an increase of 10% versus the first quarter of 2019.\\nNet income was $5.4 billion in the quarter, driven primarily by significant hedge gains, which I'll review in deeper detail on the following page. We maintained solid momentum in each of our segments, even as we faced headwinds through the latter third of the quarter.\\nOperating earnings were up at AB and in our Retirement segment, primarily driven by higher fee-type revenues and new business activity across the business was solid. SCS sales improved 11% year-over-year. Group Retirement increased inflows by 20%, driven by growth in both first year and renewal premiums. AB had its strongest retail gross sales quarter ever, with over $24 billion.\\nAnd in Protection Solutions, we continued to drive gross premium growth in our Employee Benefit business. All in all, it was another strong quarter for Equitable. And while the current social and economic environment will certainly present challenges going forward, we are navigating the uncertainty on strong footing, thanks to the resilience of our balance sheet and business model.\\nTurning now to Slide 7. I would like to review the walk from net income to non-GAAP operating earnings. This slide perfectly illustrates the disconnect between the accounting treatment of insurance assets and liabilities under U.S. GAAP. As I previously mentioned, the hedge gains of $12 billion simply reflects an increase in our economic assets to cover our economic liabilities and should not be considered excess cash.\\nIncluded in the first quarter net income results of $5.4 billion were significant noneconomic items related to VA product features, driven by GMxB hedging, realigned interest assumptions and nonperformance risk. In light of the decline in interest rates this quarter, we realigned our long-term GAAP interest rate assumptions to grade from the current spot rate to 2.25% over 10 years, following the five-year historical average for the 10-year treasury.\\nThis change resulted in unfavorable impact to net income of $1.9 billion, more than offset by year-to-date economic interest rate hedge gains of $4.4 billion, resulting in a net impact of approximately $2.4 billion post-tax this quarter.\\nBy reflecting the interest rate accounting impact today, our GAAP financial results move closer to FASB targeted improvement implementation and importantly, more closely aligns with our economic model. Additionally, we saw a significant impact this quarter related to nonperformance risk due to widening credit sprea then Anders will take you through our balance sheet and results; and lastly, Nick will give an update on what we're seeing in April and talk about the robustness of our business model.\\nSo now turning to Slide 3. During this terrible pandemic and its tremendous human and economic challenges, Equitable has a special role to play. It is times like this that we, Equitable, show our role in society.\\nOur purpose is to protect families and secure the financial well-being of our clients, so they can live long and fulfilling lives. And I'm so proud of the ingenuity and commitment of our people in delivering exactly this. 98% of the Equitable workforce is working remotely today. And of course, we are supporting our people with a comprehensive stay well program. They've done a remarkable job at accelerating our digital outreach, launching new planning tools and keeping the highest levels of service and advice to our clients.\\nWe recognize also that we are part of a wider community and that many in society need an extra hand now. Through the Equitable Foundation, we have been providing financial support, particularly geared toward feeding and educating children.\\nToday, we'll talk about earnings for the first quarter, but it's most important now that we cover the strength of our balance sheet and how our business model will fare in these volatile times. Equitable has a resilient balance sheet. Our RBC ratio is approximately 450% to 475%. We have over $1 billion of liquidity at Equitable Holdings and nearly $7 billion at Equitable Life. Our strong position today is the result of a decade-long risk management program. This includes strategies to remove basis risk exposure, pioneering volatility management tools and introducing new categories for products like buffered annuities.\\nAnd at all times, we've maintained a high-quality fixed income portfolio with strong emphasis on diversification. Most importantly, we hedge to our full economic liabilities. This means that we immunize our balance sheet to interest rates. We managed to a near zero duration gap despite a regulatory framework that is slow to react to sharp falls in interest rates. And today, still permits reverting to a 3.5% or higher interest rate level.\\nOur resilience comes not from what we've done in the past quarter or what we have done over the past decade. Looking at the first quarter results, a strong quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings per common share amounted to $1.08, up 10% year-over-year, reflecting higher AUM and delivery of our productivity and GA rebalancing strategies.\\nIn Q1 and through the end of April, we are seeing limited adverse experience on COVID-19 mortality and minimal increase in lapses or withdrawals. Recurring premium flows are solid. For April, the first month of significant disruption and social distancing, new business activity across the board was about 70% of normal levels.\\nAs of the quarter end, our AUM across both Equitable and AllianceBernstein, excluding any double count, was $646 billion, down 12% from December 31, 2019. Despite this, we remain on track to meet our stated capitalization, payout ratio and $75 million net savings targets.\\nNow looking forward, the economic outlook is, of course, uncertain, even unknown. We will not be providing today an economic forecast for what is to happen. We don't know. We will, however, reaffirm market sensitivity of our earnings, in line with prior guidance of $150 million per annum for a 10% equity market decline.\\nWe see no advantage in trying to anchor to one scenario. We know, however, it is important today, not only to give comfort about our balance sheet, but also to show you why we believe Equitable's business model is able to adapt to create value across a broad range of future scenarios.\\nWe can adapt and create value for three reasons. Firstly, remember that our large in-force portfolio gives us stability. For the year 2020, 95% of our operating revenues will come from our policies in-force on January the 1st.\\nSecond, there are three features unique about our business model. One, we have a histo l ratios are healthy.\\nAnd secondly, and obviously, we've got off with [Phonetic] somewhat normal economic conditions. And for the past several weeks and certainly back in March time, it certainly wasn't normal conditions, but markets have slowly come back, we've adapted.\\nAnd under current conditions, we should be able to meet our target for 2020 on the payout ratio.\\nSuneet Kamath -- Citi -- Analyst\\nRight. I'm just trying to get a sense of is that -- if we do go back to March 31 equity market levels, how much of an impact could that have on that payout ratio?\\nMark Pearson -- Chief Executive Officer and President\\nI think the only thing we can give you is that sensitivity what we said to earnings, and that is if markets are down 10% for a full year, that would hit earnings by $150 million.\\nYou can make your own assumptions from that.\\nSuneet Kamath -- Citi -- Analyst\\nOkay. And then the second question was on the AB stake. I think, Anders, earlier in the year, you talked about a review of the stake and getting back to investors at some point in 2020. Is that still under way?\\nAnd just curious if the impact of COVID and all the uncertainty that's causing is going to change the timing of any announcement that you guys might make on that?\\nMark Pearson -- Chief Executive Officer and President\\nSuneet, yeah, your memory is correct. We did indeed say that. But as you indicated in your question, I mean, quarter ONE has been really focused on maintaining the strength of the balance sheet; secondly, supporting our people and our clients.\\nAnd then, as Nick outlined, adapting the business model. So I think, as we said before on AB, look, we're comfortable with the 65%. It's our norm. We will get to look at it. But you're right, we haven't done anything in this quarter ONE, it's certainly not our priority.\\nSuneet Kamath -- Citi -- Analyst\\nOkay. Got it. Thank you.\\nMark Pearson -- Chief Executive Officer and President\\nThanks.\\nOperator\\nRyan Krueger with KBW, your line is open.\\nRyan Krueger -- Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods -- Analyst\\nHi. Good morning. Anders, you mentioned that you're advocating for the NAIC to change the mean reversion interest rate assumptions under STAT. I guess, can you just give us any update on if you think there's a chance that, that would happen and that they do kind of change the current methodology?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah, I would love to do so, Ryan. Good morning. But then I think this is outside of my range to predict and what regulators are doing.\\nBut look, again, I think what we just advocate here making sure that we appropriately evaluate our liabilities and make sure that on both sides of the balance sheet we have a fair value approach. I think that's the only way we have a fair representation of our liabilities, and we can actually manage our liabilities and going forward. And that's really what we're advocating for, is it under STAT? Is it under GAAP? And that's why we use our economic model, which is a full fair value model.\\nBut I cannot predict what the regulators are doing, I can just advocate in one direction.\\nRyan Krueger -- Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods -- Analyst\\nGot it. And then on the $100 million to $130 million potential COVID claims for 100,000 deaths, it seems kind of high. I guess, is that because you have a higher market share in the New York Metro Area and you adjusted the estimate to account for that?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nNo. What we did, Ryan, is really we just took the current data that we see coming out of this end of April. So -- and we just try to link that back to our portfolio. It is very hard right now to do that because there's many factors that have to go in here. It's the age. It's the region. It's the social environment people live in.\\nSo that's why we give this range. I feel confident with the range, but I -- look, I tell you, this is a lot of uncertainty here that's why we gave you that range.\\nRyan Krueger -- Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods -- Analyst\\nThank you.\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions]\\nAlex Scott with Goldman Sachs, your line is open.\\nAle unting, is that going to have a depressing impact on baseline earnings from this point forward?\\nI know there's probably some offsetting items there because there's a lower DAC asset, but probably the lower roll-forward of discount rate, I presume would play some pressure on GAAP earnings?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nRight. So maybe first and foremost, I think it's important that we have prudent assumptions in our accounting framework. Even though, I mean, as we said before, we manage to the forward rate.\\nBut the -- GAAP is not a fair value on framework, that's why we -- I think we use a very prudent and interest rate assumption going forward. This is just reflecting reality.\\nNow the biggest impact is really on Protection Solutions because of the accounting change, Protection Solutions falls back into loss recognition. And that makes Protection Solutions more volatile, but I think that's really the key issue.\\nWhat is important here as well, I mean, it really brings us just closer to the FASB target improvement framework, which we support, as you know.\\nThomas Gallagher -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\nOkay. Thanks.\\nOperator\\nSuneet Kamath with Citi, your line is open.\\nSuneet Kamath -- Citi -- Analyst\\nThanks. I wanted to go to the 50% to 60% payout ratio. Just to make sure I heard the prepared remarks correctly. So I think you had said something along the lines of that assumes equity markets are stable to April.\\nSo if we go back to, say, March 31 equity market levels, would you expect an impact on that payout ratio?\\nMark Pearson -- Chief Executive Officer and President\\nHi, Suneet. It's Mark. Let me deal with that one. Yes, as you said, we expect to achieve our target payout ratio for the year, but two conditions. Firstly, as always, that we can maintain strong management of the capital and liquidity, in particular, that we can meet our true economic liabilities.\\nAnd so far, so good there. Our portfolio continues to produce strong cash flows, hedging is working very well. And as you heard from Anders, capital ratios are healthy.\\nAnd secondly, and obviously, we've got off with [Phonetic] somewhat normal economic conditions. And for the past several weeks and certainly back in March time, it certainly wasn't normal conditions, but markets have slowly come back, we've adapted.\\nAnd under current conditions, we should be able to meet our target for 2020 on the payout ratio.\\nSuneet Kamath -- Citi -- Analyst\\nRight. I'm just trying to get a sense of is that -- if we do go back to March 31 equity market levels, how much of an impact could that have on that payout ratio?\\nMark Pearson -- Chief Executive Officer and President\\nI think the only thing we can give you is that sensitivity what we said to earnings, and that is if markets are down 10% for a full year, that would hit earnings by $150 million.\\nYou can make your own assumptions from that.\\nSuneet Kamath -- Citi -- Analyst\\nOkay. And then the second question was on the AB stake. I think, Anders, earlier in the year, you talked about a review of the stake and getting back to investors at some point in 2020. Is that still under way?\\nAnd just curious if the impact of COVID and all the uncertainty that's causing is going to change the timing of any announcement that you guys might make on that?\\nMark Pearson -- Chief Executive Officer and President\\nSuneet, yeah, your memory is correct. We did indeed say that. But as you indicated in your question, I mean, quarter ONE has been really focused on maintaining the strength of the balance sheet; secondly, supporting our people and our clients.\\nAnd then, as Nick outlined, adapting the business model. So I think, as we said before on AB, look, we're comfortable with the 65%. It's our norm. We will get to look at it. But you're right, we haven't done anything in this quarter ONE, it's certainly not our priority.\\nSuneet Kamath -- Citi -- Analyst\\nOkay. Got it. Thank you.\\nMark Pearson -- Chief Executive Officer and President\\nThanks.\\nOperator\\nRyan Krueger with KBW, your line is open.\\nRyan Krueger -- Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods -- Analyst\\nHi. Go ry of developing economically sound products, which are even more in demand today. Consumers' reaction to this virus is translating into higher demand for financial advice and family protection. Obviously, people have heightened awareness of the need to look after their families for known events like retirement and unknown events like pandemics and illnesses.\\nTwo, our affiliated distribution and broad range of third-party partnerships gives us stability and privileged access to end clients. We also benefit from the ability to change our product mix fast.\\nAnd three, we are a trusted leader in resilient sectors. We are the number one provider of retirement solutions to the K through 12 public sector educators market. And our variable annuity products provide added attraction for retirement planners in this volatile environment. We alone can provide a secure income for retirement.\\nOur subsidiary, AllianceBernstein, continues to perform well in its sector and offers us portfolio diversification and nonregulated cash flows. Finally, Equitable has benefited from our recent IPO. The whole process of setting up the company from our risk policy, establishing the initial balance sheet to CTE98 asset levels and putting in place a hedging program no longer reliant on a foreign parent has really caused us to think deeply about how we deliver value to both clients and shareholders.\\nSo despite the significant dislocation, and the uncertain short-term future, I'm confident that our robust business model and the fantastic people who make up this organization means that Equitable will continue as a strong and meaningful player.\\nSo in summary, a truly unprecedented quarter, a pandemic the like of which we have never seen and we certainly never planned for. But what we at Equitable had planned for is total immunization of our balance sheet on falls in interest rates and equity markets, and this has proven extremely valuable.\\nOur hedging program is working as designed, and today, we find ourselves with over $7 billion of liquidity in our Life company, no reliance on a future reversion to mean interest rate and a business model, which is proving its robustness at a time of extreme disruption.\\nLet me hand over now to Anders to go into more detail. Anders?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nThank you, Mark. Now turning to Slide 4. As Mark discussed, our economic model is the cornerstone of our prudent risk management, protecting our balance sheet from declines in interest rates and equity markets. And this quarter perfectly demonstrated why managing to an economic framework is so critical.\\nThose who follow us have seen elements of this page before. As this slide shows, reversion to mean interest rate assumptions under U.S. GAAP and statutory framework vary across the industry and provide a false sense of security in terms of reserving requirements.\\nOur economic balance sheet is protected from interest rates as we use the forward curve and risk neutral scenarios, including negative rates and do not make predictions about future interest rating.\\nWe are fully hedged and duration matched, ensuring our economic assets match our economic liabilities, protecting our balance sheet and future cash flows. The risk gap and statutory frameworks, both currently rely on reversion to mean assumptions to calculate reserves with some insurers still using long-term rates as high as 5%.\\nThis is completely disconnected from the reality of current rates. The truth is, we simply do not know where interest rates are headed, and we do not believe it is prudent for clients or shareholders to take a position here and expose our balance sheet to unnecessary risk. As you can see on the slide, have we managed to our liabilities under GAAP or STAT, we would have been underhedged to our true economic liability by approximately $7 billion and $2 billion, respectively. Our U.S. GAAP financial results perfectly highlights this disconnect between the accounting treatment and the actual movement of our underlying assets and liabilities.\\nAs we hedge to our economic liabil a decline in new teacher applications as we continue to focus on our existing million educators through this period.\\nAnd given, as was mentioned -- given the renewals and recurring nature of our retirement solutions, flows remain solid.\\nOn Protection, we are seeing an enhanced interest in Protection-type products. We have pivoted toward our express underwriting for term and modified our -- some of our policies capping the face amounts that we will provide without bloods and fluids.\\nSo the ranges within that $70 million would be down 50% in certain lines and to about 10%, but it's still unknown.\\nWe continue to focus on our clients. And we believe that given our remote outreach and magnifying our voice that's going to present and position us well to emerge stronger on the other side.\\nAnders, do you want to chip in there?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah. Look, just quickly on your question about the impact from sales on our balance sheet. But as we said before, I mean, the balance sheet is very strong. And I don't think that the sales -- obviously, we monitor the sales, but this will have no impact on the balance sheet in this period.\\nElyse Greenspan -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\\nOkay. Thank you for the color.\\nOperator\\nTom Gallagher with Evercore, your line is open.\\nThomas Gallagher -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\nGood morning. A question on -- Anders, if you're overhedged on the new statutory framework because that's using mean reversion and you're not, shouldn't your RBC ratio have gone up in a quarter where rates plunge like they did?\\nAnd because it didn't, is the difference due to the use of treasuries as part of the hedging program?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. So Tom, look, I think the RBC, as you said, I mean, uses the mean reversion still and going back to 3.5% and we hedge to the forward curve.\\nSo we overhedged statutory on the interest rates. But as you say, we use our treasuries really to hedge about 20%, 25% of it. So it's about $2 billion gains that we have that didn't flow through the statutory and P&L. So it didn't flow through the RBC.\\nAnd then as you know, I mean, you don't hedge the base products. So we have exposure on the base fee. So that's why overall, I think, the balance sheet is very strong on RBC and it doesn't reflect the hedges that go through the general account.\\nThomas Gallagher -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\nThat makes sense. So what would happen if rates continue to go down and it negatively impacted your RBC, would the plan be to sell and rebuy treasury securities to book the gain or how should I think about that?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nSo first of all, I mean, as we said, we hedge to the economic liabilities and I think that's foremost, that's our target. And then I said a portion goes through the general account. So I don't expect that this will change. I think that's a very strong hedge we have. I don't give you the projections on RBC, but I can guarantee you that we manage that to make sure that we are above our target.\\nThomas Gallagher -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\nGot it. And I know New York has implemented their own variable annuity standards. Just in light of what they've announced, are you still confident in getting dividends out of your New York subsidiary on a consistent basis despite that rule change? Thanks.\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah, right. Look, as we discussed during the last call a quarter ago, I mean, New York has this new rollout. It's a New York floor. We discussed at that time as well that I think in the short term, it's not that impactful, but it will -- it can become problematic, in particular, if markets go up.\\nRight now, I think it's the opposite. So we feel very confident in the short term. But it's something we have to work with New York and to make sure that we have sustainable dividend even in the long term.\\nThomas Gallagher -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\nOkay. Thanks. And then just if I could sneak one more in. The -- regarding your reduction in future interest rate assumptions for GAAP acco ry of developing economically sound products, which are even more in demand today. Consumers' reaction to this virus is translating into higher demand for financial advice and family protection. Obviously, people have heightened awareness of the need to look after their families for known events like retirement and unknown events like pandemics and illnesses.\\nTwo, our affiliated distribution and broad range of third-party partnerships gives us stability and privileged access to end clients.

Anders?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nThank you, Mark. Now turning to Slide 4. As Mark discussed, our economic model is the cornerstone of our prudent risk management, protecting our balance sheet from declines in interest rates and equity markets. And this quarter perfectly demonstrated why managing to an economic framework is so critical.\\nThose who follow us have seen elements of this page before.

As you can see on the slide, have we managed to our liabilities under GAAP or STAT, we would have been underhedged to our true economic liability by approximately $7 billion and $2 billion, respectively. Our U.S. GAAP financial results perfectly highlights this disconnect between the accounting treatment and the actual movement of our underlying assets and liabilities.\\nAs we hedge to our economic liabil ss was solid. SCS sales improved 11% year-over-year. Group Retirement increased inflows by 20%, driven by growth in both first year and renewal premiums. AB had its strongest retail gross sales quarter ever, with over $24 billion.\\nAnd in Protection Solutions, we continued to drive gross premium growth in our Employee Benefit business. All in all, it was another strong quarter for Equitable. And while the current social and economic environment will certainly present challenges going forward, we are navigating the uncertainty on strong footing, thanks to the resilience of our balance sheet and business model.\\nTurning now to Slide 7. I would like to review the walk from net income to non-GAAP operating earnings. This slide perfectly illustrates the disconnect between the accounting treatment of insurance assets and liabilities under U.S. GAAP. As I previously mentioned, the hedge gains of $12 billion simply reflects an increase in our economic assets to cover our economic liabilities and should not be considered excess cash.\\nIncluded in the first quarter net income results of $5.4 billion were significant noneconomic items related to VA product features, driven by GMxB hedging, realigned interest assumptions and nonperformance risk. In light of the decline in interest rates this quarter, we realigned our long-term GAAP interest rate assumptions to grade from the current spot rate to 2.25% over 10 years, following the five-year historical average for the 10-year treasury.\\nThis change resulted in unfavorable impact to net income of $1.9 billion, more than offset by year-to-date economic interest rate hedge gains of $4.4 billion, resulting in a net impact of approximately $2.4 billion post-tax this quarter.\\nBy reflecting the interest rate accounting impact today, our GAAP financial results move closer to FASB targeted improvement implementation and importantly, more closely aligns with our economic model. Additionally, we saw a significant impact this quarter related to nonperformance risk due to widening credit spreads. This measure, which considers our credit risk, impacts the calculation of the estimated fair value of liabilities.\\nFor additional context, should credit spreads narrow, we would expect the opposite impact. To reiterate, this impact during the quarter helped to illustrate precisely why we believe operating earnings is the best proxy for analyzing our performance. As equities sharply declined and interest rates fell in the first quarter, our adjustment was positive, in line with our expectations and previously communicated guidance.\\nFinally, other adjustments to net income this quarter primarily include impacts related to the realignment of GAAP interest rate assumptions in our Protection Solutions and Group Retirement segments and taxes. I would now like to highlight our capital and liquidity position outlined on Slide 8.\\nAs Mark mentioned earlier, the challenging economic environment this quarter has truly allowed us to demonstrate the strength and resiliency of our balance sheet. Last quarter, we announced our new minimum capitalization target of 375% to 400% RBC.\\nThis quarter, despite the S&P falling 20% and U.S. Treasury rates reaching historic lows, we closed the quarter with an RBC ratio of 450% to 475%, continuing to remain well in excess of our minimum target, including CTE98 for VAs. Our hedging target is the economic liability, which assumes the forward curve for interest rates compared to the statutory framework, which relies on a 3.5% reversion to mean assumption. Because we are fully hedged on interest rates, we are overhedged on a statutory basis. This does not imply that we have more excess capital, rather, the increase in assets match the movements in our economic liabilities.\\nAs a result, the interest rate hedge gains protected our RBC during this highly volatile quarter. In terms of liquidity, our well-diversified sources helped to further fortify our balance sheet. As of the end of the first quarter, cash and liquid assets were approximately $1 billion at the holding company, above our $500  dn't flow through the statutory and P&L. So it didn't flow through the RBC.\\nAnd then as you know, I mean, you don't hedge the base products. So we have exposure on the base fee. So that's why overall, I think, the balance sheet is very strong on RBC and it doesn't reflect the hedges that go through the general account.\\nThomas Gallagher -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\nThat makes sense. So what would happen if rates continue to go down and it negatively impacted your RBC, would the plan be to sell and rebuy treasury securities to book the gain or how should I think about that?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nSo first of all, I mean, as we said, we hedge to the economic liabilities and I think that's foremost, that's our target. And then I said a portion goes through the general account. So I don't expect that this will change. I think that's a very strong hedge we have. I don't give you the projections on RBC, but I can guarantee you that we manage that to make sure that we are above our target.\\nThomas Gallagher -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\nGot it. And I know New York has implemented their own variable annuity standards. Just in light of what they've announced, are you still confident in getting dividends out of your New York subsidiary on a consistent basis despite that rule change? Thanks.\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah, right. Look, as we discussed during the last call a quarter ago, I mean, New York has this new rollout. It's a New York floor. We discussed at that time as well that I think in the short term, it's not that impactful, but it will -- it can become problematic, in particular, if markets go up.\\nRight now, I think it's the opposite. So we feel very confident in the short term. But it's something we have to work with New York and to make sure that we have sustainable dividend even in the long term.\\nThomas Gallagher -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\nOkay. Thanks. And then just if I could sneak one more in. The -- regarding your reduction in future interest rate assumptions for GAAP accounting, is that going to have a depressing impact on baseline earnings from this point forward?\\nI know there's probably some offsetting items there because there's a lower DAC asset, but probably the lower roll-forward of discount rate, I presume would play some pressure on GAAP earnings?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nRight. So maybe first and foremost, I think it's important that we have prudent assumptions in our accounting framework. Even though, I mean, as we said before, we manage to the forward rate.\\nBut the -- GAAP is not a fair value on framework, that's why we -- I think we use a very prudent and interest rate assumption going forward. This is just reflecting reality.\\nNow the biggest impact is really on Protection Solutions because of the accounting change, Protection Solutions falls back into loss recognition. And that makes Protection Solutions more volatile, but I think that's really the key issue.\\nWhat is important here as well, I mean, it really brings us just closer to the FASB target improvement framework, which we support, as you know.\\nThomas Gallagher -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\nOkay. Thanks.\\nOperator\\nSuneet Kamath with Citi, your line is open.\\nSuneet Kamath -- Citi -- Analyst\\nThanks. I wanted to go to the 50% to 60% payout ratio. Just to make sure I heard the prepared remarks correctly. So I think you had said something along the lines of that assumes equity markets are stable to April.\\nSo if we go back to, say, March 31 equity market levels, would you expect an impact on that payout ratio?\\nMark Pearson -- Chief Executive Officer and President\\nHi, Suneet. It's Mark. Let me deal with that one. Yes, as you said, we expect to achieve our target payout ratio for the year, but two conditions. Firstly, as always, that we can maintain strong management of the capital and liquidity, in particular, that we can meet our true economic liabilities.\\nAnd so far, so good there. Our portfolio continues to produce strong cash flows, hedging is working very well. And as you heard from Anders, capita a decline in new teacher applications as we continue to focus on our existing million educators through this period.\\nAnd given, as was mentioned -- given the renewals and recurring nature of our retirement solutions, flows remain solid.\\nOn Protection, we are seeing an enhanced interest in Protection-type products. We have pivoted toward our express underwriting for term and modified our -- some of our policies capping the face amounts that we will provide without bloods and fluids.\\nSo the ranges within that $70 million would be down 50% in certain lines and to about 10%, but it's still unknown.\\nWe continue to focus on our clients. And we believe that given our remote outreach and magnifying our voice that's going to present and position us well to emerge stronger on the other side.\\nAnders, do you want to chip in there?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah. Look, just quickly on your question about the impact from sales on our balance sheet. But as we said before, I mean, the balance sheet is very strong. And I don't think that the sales -- obviously, we monitor the sales, but this will have no impact on the balance sheet in this period.\\nElyse Greenspan -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\\nOkay. Thank you for the color.\\nOperator\\nTom Gallagher with Evercore, your line is open.\\nThomas Gallagher -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\nGood morning. A question on -- Anders, if you're overhedged on the new statutory framework because that's using mean reversion and you're not, shouldn't your RBC ratio have gone up in a quarter where rates plunge like they did?\\nAnd because it didn't, is the difference due to the use of treasuries as part of the hedging program?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. So Tom, look, I think the RBC, as you said, I mean, uses the mean reversion still and going back to 3.5% and we hedge to the forward curve.\\nSo we overhedged statutory on the interest rates. But as you say, we use our treasuries really to hedge about 20%, 25% of it. So it's about $2 billion gains that we have that didn't flow through the statutory and P&L. So it didn't flow through the RBC.\\nAnd then as you know, I mean, you don't hedge the base products. So we have exposure on the base fee. So that's why overall, I think, the balance sheet is very strong on RBC and it doesn't reflect the hedges that go through the general account.\\nThomas Gallagher -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\nThat makes sense. So what would happen if rates continue to go down and it negatively impacted your RBC, would the plan be to sell and rebuy treasury securities to book the gain or how should I think about that?\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nSo first of all, I mean, as we said, we hedge to the economic liabilities and I think that's foremost, that's our target. And then I said a portion goes through the general account. So I don't expect that this will change. I think that's a very strong hedge we have. I don't give you the projections on RBC, but I can guarantee you that we manage that to make sure that we are above our target.\\nThomas Gallagher -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\nGot it. And I know New York has implemented their own variable annuity standards. Just in light of what they've announced, are you still confident in getting dividends out of your New York subsidiary on a consistent basis despite that rule change? Thanks.\\nAnders Malmstrom -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah, right. Look, as we discussed during the last call a quarter ago, I mean, New York has this new rollout. It's a New York floor. We discussed at that time as well that I think in the short term, it's not that impactful, but it will -- it can become problematic, in particular, if markets go up.\\nRight now, I think it's the opposite. So we feel very confident in the short term. But it's something we have to work with New York and to make sure that we have sustainable dividend even in the long term.\\nThomas Gallagher -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\nOkay. Thanks. And then just if I could sneak one more in. The -- regarding your reduction in future interest rate assumptions for GAAP acco ratio of approximately 450% to 475%, this implies a pro forma RBC of approximately 390% to 520% under this total range of stress scenarios, maintaining our dividend capability and capitalization in excess of the Company's 375% to 400% minimum RBC target.\\nAlso, as a reminder, we were an early adopter of the NAIC VA reform, which utilizes a more conservative RBC calculation referenced here versus those who have not adopted. While we recognize that no two crisis or shocks are the same and that we are certainly not immune to losses, we are defensively positioned, strongly capitalized and well prepared to both protect our balance sheet and capitalize on unique investment opportunities within our risk framework.\\nI will now hand the call over to Nick to shed more light on how the business is operating in the current landscape.\\nNick Lane -- President of Equitable\\nThank you, Anders. As you saw, we had strong momentum in the first quarter, but we now face a very different environment.\\nWe remain steadfast in our focus on three areas outlined here on Page 10: guiding our clients through these volatile times and adapting our businesses to support them; magnifying our outreach to the communities we proudly serve; and as always, taking care of our employees, ensuring they're wealthy.\\nOn the first pillar, we've been pivoting our business processes, leveraging our remote capabilities to serve our clients. Our affiliated sales force with 4,300 advisors nationwide is providing advice directly to roughly 3 million Americans. The health pandemic has generated increased interest in protection products. We have implemented refined COVID-19 underwriting policies, modifying the need for invasive blood and fluid requirements, while deploying new national and state policy guidelines on premium forbearance.\\nOn our second pillar, we're magnifying our outreach to the communities we serve. Americans daily lives have fundamentally changed and we have launched several programs to help. The loss of peace of mind, social connectivity and increased family demands are taking a toll on people's mental well being. Through efforts such as our plan what you can program, we are helping people pull through this difficult period by planning new norms and rituals.\\nIn addition, as a firm, we are active in direct relief efforts, donating supplies to local medical facilities and committing $1 million to help community activities, which keep kids learning, feed the hungry and support center for disease control activities.\\nFinally, ensuring our employees can deliver on our mission while remaining safe is a critical priority. We see advisors and clients working remotely using our full suite of digital engagement, processing and servicing tools to ensure access to their financial assets, awareness of the policy benefits and relief actions.\\nWe expect this digital amplification to open up new opportunities for the future. As Mark mentioned, this is when our mission to help Americans secure long and fulfilling lives comes to the forefront. And I'm very proud of the way our teams have responded.\\nOur business model remains robust and adaptable, driven by the three factors outlined here on Page 11. First, our products remain profitable and in demand. Over the past decade, innovation in designing resilient products anchored in economic realities has been at our core.\\nToday, we are the market leader of structured annuities, providing upside potential and downside protection, helping clients in these volatile markets. While on the protection side, we have a robust product portfolio, focused on capital-light sectors like VUL to address enhanced mortality concerns.\\nAs Anders highlighted, we have been a pioneer in taking meaningful product and in-force actions, drive better risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders and clients. Next, our distribution size and breadth provides privileged ways to access clients. Equitable advisors or affiliated sales force gives us direct access to end client needs and behaviors.\\nThrough many volatile times, it has provided stable, profitable growth a  downside protection is really an asset during these volatile times.\\nJimmy Bhullar -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\\nOkay.

Yes.\\nSteve Moss -- B Riley, FBR -- Analyst\\nAnd then as we think about the margin going forward, I would assume that you're going to pick up in commercial plans growth here in the upcoming quarter. Just kind of thinking about the different drivers you do have obviously, lower rates what you should probably be getting funding benefits. Just any color on the margin would be great.\\nBrad Hanson -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYes, we had a step down this quarter in accretion. Next quarter will be our final big step down in accretion. So I would expect margin to increase a little bit. The mix shift will help offset the accretion that will run off and so we should be flat to up a few basis points next quarter and then start legging up through the rest of 2020.\\nSteve Moss -- B Riley, FBR -- Analyst\\nOkay, that's helpful. And then on expenses, just wanted to circle back to that. Wondering what is a cleaner run rate going forward with the cost saves that were disclosed here?\\nGlen Herrick -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes, so I'll get to your question specifically, but as you know, we have a fair amount of seasonality in our run rate's, primarily, taxes and it kicks up here in December and then runs through March, first part of April. So certainly the March quarter is always a higher expense quarter, a lot of variable expenses. Where we're at today? The September quarter is typically a lower expense quarter for us although we did have the one-time expenses. So that said, I would -- I think it's good to build a base from perhaps the September quarter. Again, there are a fair amount of variable expenses so as the business grows there are some variable ones that will grow with it. So I think starting with this September quarter and then building your growth from there.\\nSteve Moss -- B Riley, FBR -- Analyst\\nOkay. And lastly just on credit here, the reserve, underlying reservation I think looks like continues to build ex-tax, I would assume you would probably have one last leg up with accretion runoff here this quarter. Just kind of your thoughts around credit costs for the upcoming quarters as the allowance normalizes?\\nGlen Herrick -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes, we feel, as Brad mentioned, we feel good about our position in our allowance today. I think it'll depend on the mix of our assets, but you can assume that we'll probably end up around 100 basis points or so or a little higher actually, blended allowance, again, depending where the mix comes from and we'll build provision to maintain that level.\\nOperator\\nAnd our next question comes from Daniel Cardenas with Raymond James.

While fiscal 2019 marked a year of significant change in progress, we believe there is much more to come in furtherance of our key strategic initiatives as we continue to execute on the key pillars of our plan, while providing tailored services for our customers, opportunities for our employees and driving more value for shareholders, and we believe our execution will allow us to deliver significant earnings growth in the year ahead.\\nNow let me turn it over to Glen Herrick, our CFO, to provide a review of our fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal 2019 financial results.\\nGlen Herrick -- Chief Financial Officer\\nThank you, Brad, and good afternoon, everyone. Today we are pleased to report our results for the fourth fiscal quarter and full fiscal year 2019. On a GAAP basis, we generated net income of $20.2 million for the quarter or $0.53 per diluted share and $97 million or $2.49 per diluted share for the year. Full-year earnings-per-share growth of 49% over the prior year primarily reflected higher net interest income as a result of the Crestmark acquisition and efforts to optimize the mix of our balance sheet. Over the past year, we continued to build out our commercial finance portfolio and work toward improving our funding mix. Furthermore, we originated $104 million in solar leases during the year which related investment tax credits driving higher after-tax income. Though the timing and impact of future investment tax credits are expected to vary from period to period, we expect the tax rate for fiscal year 2020 to settle in the low teens.\\nTurning to the balance sheet, average interest-earning assets remained relatively flat on a linked quarter basis reflecting efforts to focus on enhancing our earnings asset mix instead of balance sheet growth. During the fourth quarter, we selectively sold lower yielding investment securities reducing our average holdings by 10% on a linked quarter basis and replaced them with higher-yielding loans primarily within our commercial finance portfolio. Total gross loans and leases were $3.65 billion at September 30, again, relatively flat on a linked quarter basis despite the seasonal runoff of tax related loans and the transfer of certain consumer loan products held for sale and up 24% from September 30, 2018. Our commercial finance portfolio was $1.92 billion at September 30, an increase of 4% on a linked quarter basis and 27% year-over-year meaningfully outperforming our initial 15% forecast for loan growth at the time of the merger.\\nOn Slide seven, we provide more color on the components of our commercial finance portfolio, for example, our asset-based lending portfolio average loan size was approximately $775,000 and average yield was 9.67% for the quarter and the approximate net charge-off rate was 60 basis points over the past three years. Turning to the liabilities side of the balance sheet, average payments deposits grew by 11% compared to the same quarter in the prior fiscal year and represented 57% of total average deposits. As a result of the balance sheet remix, we generated $65.6 million of net interest income in the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter, up 35% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, while our net interest margin expanded by 90 basis points year-over-year to 4.95% for the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter. Purchase accounting accretion contributed 14 basis points to the net interest margin in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, a decrease of 11 basis points from the third quarter, and we expect minimal contribution in fiscal 2020 as adjustments related to the purchase loan and lease portfolio from Crestmark are expected to wind down. Loan yields were 7.51% for the quarter compared to 7.77% for the previous quarter and 7.21% for the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year.\\nPurchase accounting accretion added 20 basis points to loan yields in the fourth quarter versus 37 basis points in the third quarter. Meta's provision for loan and lease losses was $4.1 million for the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter compared to $4.7 million for the fourth quarter of the p  shareholder value.

[Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference call over to Brittany Elsasser, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\\nBrittany Elsasser -- Director of Investor Relations\\nThank you, and welcome to Meta's conference call and webcast to discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, released earlier this afternoon. Additional information, including the earnings release and investor presentation, may be found on our website at metafinancialgroup.com. President and CEO, Brad Hanson; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Glen Herrick, will be sharing some prepared remarks today before we open up the call for questions. Today's call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements related to Meta and its operating subsidiaries, which may generally be identified as describing the company's future plans, goals or objectives. We caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those currently anticipated or that we otherwise discussed today\\nThese forward-looking statements are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. For further information about the factors that could affect Meta's future results, please see the company's most recent annual and quarterly reports filed on Form 10-K and 10-Q and its other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made. Meta expressly disclaims any intent or obligation to update any forward-looking statements on behalf of the company or its subsidiaries whether as a result of new information, changed circumstances, future events or for any other reason.\\nAt this time, I would now like to turn the call over to President and CEO, Brad Hanson.\\nBrad Hanson -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you, Brittany. For fiscal 2019, Meta reported GAAP net income of $97 million or $2.49 per diluted share, one of several key accomplishments made during the year. This includes the previously announced executive transition expense of $0.12 per diluted share after-tax incurred in the fiscal second quarter and severance expenses of $0.07 per diluted share after-tax incurred in the fourth fiscal quarter as part of our initiative to optimize organizational resources and improve efficiency ratios. These results reflect the earnings power of the company and the impact our key initiatives are having on the business. Before I turn it over to Glenn for detailed account of the financial results, I'd like to take a bit more time to talk about the progress we are making on our key initiatives, increasing core deposits, improving our earning asset mix, and improving our efficiency ratio.\\nFirst, we work to accelerate the positive growth within our payments division by increasing business development efforts and streamlining processes making it easier for us strategic partners to do business with us. We were rewarded by the renewal and extension of existing relationships while also developing several new relationships. During fiscal 2019, average deposits from our Payments division grew 11% over the average for the fiscal year 2018. At the same time, we are positioning ourselves to take advantage of fee income opportunities in areas such as merchant acquiring, ACH origination and our faster Payments initiatives. Second, we are improving our interest earnings asset mix by replacing lower yielding loans and investment securities with higher yielding commercial loans, while maintaining a strong credit profile.\\nAs shown on Slide four of our investor presentation, quarterly average commercial finance loans accounted for 36% of our total earnings assets as of September 30, 2019, up from  nson -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nWant to start?\\nGlen Herrick -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes, so we're kind of coming off this tough comparison because of the 1 times, that's from comparing FY '19 to fiscal year '18. That fiscal year '20 will be clean comparisons going forward. So we would expect this last quarter to be a low point in card fee income and that we will leg up from here. A number of our large programs are customized price. Depending on where the economics may fall and the characteristics of the deposits, how stable they are, they may be more seasonal. And so that all drives your card fee income. There are some tier pricings for some of our larger customers as they cross thresholds. So card fee income is an important driver of revenue for us, but overall, I would expect it to grow out at a slightly -- I expect it to grow from here, expected to grow at a slightly slower pace than overall deposit growth from the Payments business.\\nBrad Hanson -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nAnd you might note that some of the card fee income has transferred into the deposit fee line. So you need to take that into account as well and then finally as I've mentioned in my remarks, we are starting to evolve several new lines areas of business in merchant acquiring, our ACH origination which we have been involved in the past and our faster payments initiatives, which will all be more fee income based products. So those over the course of the next year and the year after, will start to have a more meaningful impact.\\nMichael Perito -- KBW -- Analyst\\nHelpful. And then just lastly, as we think about obviously, the card issuing you guys have done in the prepaid space, you've done really well. You start to see some of your competitors branch out to non -- like prepaid card program managers like banks like, well, they are not really banks, but partner companies like Chime and things of that nature. I'm just curious if you could kind of flush out a little bit for us, where your heads are at in terms of kind of expanding the ability to white label our card issue, your banking services and what we can kind of expect because it seems like a big priority for the next couple of years what we can kind of expect to see on that front moving forward.\\nGlen Herrick -- Chief Financial Officer\\nAnd that's why you seen some of the fee income, card fee income move into the deposit fee line, because several of our partners and new relationships are involved with those exact type of products you're discussing. We are in support of those kinds of products.\\nMichael Perito -- KBW -- Analyst\\nOkay, so I guess more to come in and stay tuned?\\nGlen Herrick -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes.\\nBrad Hanson -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYes. We are certainly involved and as payments evolves and we'll partner with strong relationships where we find them. I would note, Mike, overall our total fee income represented roughly 45%, 46% of overall revenues and we would hope it would stay at that level or be a higher percentage actually in 2020.\\nMichael Perito -- KBW -- Analyst\\nGreat, well, all helpful. Thank you guys for the color. I appreciate it.\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Steve Moss with B. Riley FBR. Your line is open.\\nSteve Moss -- B Riley, FBR -- Analyst\\nI want to start on the commercial finance yields, they are down about 65 basis points or so quarter-over-quarter. Just wondering what the underlying dynamics were there for the quarter and how we should think about that going forward?\\nBrad Hanson -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nWell, we had a leg down in the purchase accretion, which contributed to that. There are a fair amount of variable rate loan products in that portfolio and then it's just a mix of somewhat of a mix shift, some portfolios in commercial finance are growing faster than others.\\nSteve Moss -- B Riley, FBR -- Analyst\\nIn terms of the variable rate, roughly what idea percentage is variable within a portfolio. I know the Premium Finances, for example?\\nBrad Hanson -- President and Chief nson -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nWant to start?\\nGlen Herrick -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes, so we're kind of coming off this tough comparison because of the 1 times, that's from comparing FY '19 to fiscal year '18. That fiscal year '20 will be clean comparisons going forward. So we would expect this last quarter to be a low point in card fee income and that we will leg up from here. A number of our large programs are customized price. Depending on where the economics may fall and the characteristics of the deposits, how stable they are, they may be more seasonal. And so that all drives your card fee income. There are some tier pricings for some of our larger customers as they cross thresholds.

We -- The people that were in our IT department will be absorbed by the outsourcing company. So they will continue to be working here with us, but for the most part, they were not impacted by the severance.\\nFrank Schiraldi -- Sandler O'Neill -- Analyst\\nAnd is there any detail you can give on as you make that transition, impact to the income statement?\\nBrad Hanson -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nWell, we are looking for a positive impact over time. There is a transition period that will occur and it's primarily in the commodity base parts of the IT infrastructure business.\\nFrank Schiraldi -- Sandler O'Neill -- Analyst\\nOkay, and then just on the consumer loan balances, you transferred some to for sale, you mentioned obviously, the held for investment balances sell linked quarter. Just wondering, it didn't look like from your slide that you're further deemphasizing that business, but are you looking to shrink that portfolio? Or keep it stable at these levels?\\nBrad Hanson -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nNo, as we have mentioned, we plan to manage the consumer lending business to be within 15% of our earning assets. That's still our plan going forward, but we are taking a very measured approach as we develop those programs and portfolios to make sure that our infrastructure and capacity to manage them appropriately, especially, going into this part of the credit cycle is very sound.\\nFrank Schiraldi -- Sandler O'Neill -- Analyst\\nOkay, and then just one more and I'll go back into the queue. Just in terms of, obviously, people talk about we're getting later in the economic cycle here, some players tend to pull back from things like factoring and asset-backed lending at those times. I assume or believe it's not the plan for Crestmark. I'm just wondering if that maybe has created or is creating more opportunity for you and you could maybe just, any sort of color you can give on expected or anticipated growth rate in the Crestmark business from here.\\nBrad Hanson -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nWe have been consistent in saying, as we looked at the Crestmark performance over the prior years that their performance is sound during times of downturns as well as up cycles. As we see competition and people stretching in areas to compromise on structure and pricing, we try to remain very disciplined in that and then over time we believe that it will create opportunities for us.\\nFrank Schiraldi -- Sandler O'Neill -- Analyst\\nI mean, do you expect that business to continue to grow in the double digits? Or what's a decent growth rate, I guess?\\nGlen Herrick -- Chief Financial Officer\\nFrank, this is Glen. Certainly as the denominator becomes larger, we would expect to see some slowing of growth, but we are expecting double-digit growth year-over-year and it could come from different levers there. We have a broad set of products to serve our customers and I would also just -- to add on some color to Brad's comments about the credit cycle, also point you to the -- not all factory and an asset based lending are created equal and while the portfolios that we have are certainly higher return portfolios than our traditional community bank portfolios, they are also not the high cost -- the higher cost factoring or ABL type products, they are a little lower in the credit quality range.\\nFrank Schiraldi -- Sandler O'Neill -- Analyst\\nOkay, I'm sorry, you said they are lower in terms of the factoring as well?\\nGlen Herrick -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. So, let's say we are -- we've got yields of 9.7% for a portfolio and as you go down in credit quality there may be other players in those that do factoring or ABL that are charging 18% to 20% to 36%. And that's usually the reflection of the credit quality or the credit risk inherent in the customers they are serving. So there's a lot of different flavors of the commercial finance business.\\nFrank Schiraldi -- Sandler O'Neill -- Analyst\\nOkay. All right. I appreciate it.

[Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference call over to Brittany Elsasser, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\\nBrittany Elsasser -- Director of Investor Relations\\nThank you, and welcome to Meta's conference call and webcast to discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, released earlier this afternoon. Additional information, including the earnings release and investor presentation, may be found on our website at metafinancialgroup.com. President and CEO, Brad Hanson; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Glen Herrick, will be sharing some prepared remarks today before we open up the call for questions. Today's call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements related to Meta and its operating subsidiaries, which may generally be identified as describing the company's future plans, goals or objectives. We caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those currently anticipated or that we otherwise discussed today\\nThese forward-looking statements are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. For further information about the factors that could affect Meta's future results, please see the company's most recent annual and quarterly reports filed on Form 10-K and 10-Q and its other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made. Meta expressly disclaims any intent or obligation to update any forward-looking statements on behalf of the company or its subsidiaries whether as a result of new information, changed circumstances, future events or for any other reason.\\nAt this time, I would now like to turn the call over to President and CEO, Brad Hanson.\\nBrad Hanson -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you, Brittany. For fiscal 2019, Meta reported GAAP net income of $97 million or $2.49 per diluted share, one of several key accomplishments made during the year. This includes the previously announced executive transition expense of $0.12 per diluted share after-tax incurred in the fiscal second quarter and severance expenses of $0.07 per diluted share after-tax incurred in the fourth fiscal quarter as part of our initiative to optimize organizational resources and improve efficiency ratios. These results reflect the earnings power of the company and the impact our key initiatives are having on the business. Before I turn it over to Glenn for detailed account of the financial results, I'd like to take a bit more time to talk about the progress we are making on our key initiatives, increasing core deposits, improving our earning asset mix, and improving our efficiency ratio.\\nFirst, we work to accelerate the positive growth within our payments division by increasing business development efforts and streamlining processes making it easier for us strategic partners to do business with us. We were rewarded by the renewal and extension of existing relationships while also developing several new relationships. During fiscal 2019, average deposits from our Payments division grew 11% over the average for the fiscal year 2018. At the same time, we are positioning ourselves to take advantage of fee income opportunities in areas such as merchant acquiring, ACH origination and our faster Payments initiatives. Second, we are improving our interest earnings asset mix by replacing lower yielding loans and investment securities with higher yielding commercial loans, while maintaining a strong credit profile.\\nAs shown on Slide four of our investor presentation, quarterly average commercial finance loans accounted for 36% of our total earnings assets as of September 30, 2019, up from  Prepared Remarks:\\nOperator\\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Meta Financial Group Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2019 Investor Conference Call.

Thanks.\\nOperator\\nThank you, and our next  question comes from Michael Perito with KBW.\\nMichael Perito -- KBW -- Analyst\\nHey, good afternoon, everybody. And, Mike, I wanted to ask a kind of a big picture question on capital here. Obviously, after the stronger level in the third quarter, the repurchase has slowed a bit in the fourth quarter and the shares have obviously done quite well with bringing your multiple up, but obviously no rush around this because your capital levels are healthy today, but I wouldn't say anything major, but in the comp plans as I look forward, obviously, you guys are motivated to keep your balance sheet under $10 billion, which can somewhat limit the capital you need for balance sheet growth anyway and I'm just wondering how do you guys think about -- as your business matures and becomes more profitable with maybe a lower percentage growth rate, the capital you return to shareholders would seem like the level of buybacks you've done recently isn't sustainable longer-term, just curious how you guys are thinking about that dynamic as you evolve here.\\nGlen Herrick -- Chief Financial Officer\\nWell, as we stated, we expect to generate excess capital in 2020 and beyond, and we will certainly consider repurchase activity within the context of overall capital management as the board and management reviews our options.\\nMichael Perito -- KBW -- Analyst\\nAt any point does the dividend come into play or is that really...\\nGlen Herrick -- Chief Financial Officer\\nIt's certainly one of the levers -- yes, again, it's certainly one of the levers that the company will consider.\\nMichael Perito -- KBW -- Analyst\\nOkay. As we pick out the card fee line on the P side, it was a bit lower than it's been for quite some time now but I know it's an area of focus, just any unusual followups or expectations about that line item as we move forward and what you guys think is realistic, is there any other volatility expected near-term or is there something -- or is there a pipeline for growth. Just curious if you could provide us some more thoughts there.\\nBrad Hanson -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nWant to start?\\nGlen Herrick -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes, so we're kind of coming off this tough comparison because of the 1 times, that's from comparing FY '19 to fiscal year '18. That fiscal year '20 will be clean comparisons going forward. So we would expect this last quarter to be a low point in card fee income and that we will leg up from here. A number of our large programs are customized price. Depending on where the economics may fall and the characteristics of the deposits, how stable they are, they may be more seasonal. And so that all drives your card fee income. There are some tier pricings for some of our larger customers as they cross thresholds. So card fee income is an important driver of revenue for us, but overall, I would expect it to grow out at a slightly -- I expect it to grow from here, expected to grow at a slightly slower pace than overall deposit growth from the Payments business.\\nBrad Hanson -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nAnd you might note that some of the card fee income has transferred into the deposit fee line. So you need to take that into account as well and then finally as I've mentioned in my remarks, we are starting to evolve several new lines areas of business in merchant acquiring, our ACH origination which we have been involved in the past and our faster payments initiatives, which will all be more fee income based products. So those over the course of the next year and the year after, will start to have a more meaningful impact.\\nMichael Perito -- KBW -- Analyst\\nHelpful. And then just lastly, as we think about obviously, the card issuing you guys have done in the prepaid space, you've done really well. You start to see some of your competitors branch out to non -- like prepaid card program managers like banks like, well, they are not really banks, but partner companies like Chime and things of that nature. I'm just curious if you could kind of flush out a little bit for us, where your heads are at in terms of kind of   Executive Officer\\nIt is about 40%, roughly plus or minus. Yes.\\nSteve Moss -- B Riley, FBR -- Analyst\\nAnd then as we think about the margin going forward, I would assume that you're going to pick up in commercial plans growth here in the upcoming quarter. Just kind of thinking about the different drivers you do have obviously, lower rates what you should probably be getting funding benefits. Just any color on the margin would be great.\\nBrad Hanson -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYes, we had a step down this quarter in accretion. Next quarter will be our final big step down in accretion. So I would expect margin to increase a little bit. The mix shift will help offset the accretion that will run off and so we should be flat to up a few basis points next quarter and then start legging up through the rest of 2020.\\nSteve Moss -- B Riley, FBR -- Analyst\\nOkay, that's helpful. And then on expenses, just wanted to circle back to that. Wondering what is a cleaner run rate going forward with the cost saves that were disclosed here?\\nGlen Herrick -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes, so I'll get to your question specifically, but as you know, we have a fair amount of seasonality in our run rate's, primarily, taxes and it kicks up here in December and then runs through March, first part of April. So certainly the March quarter is always a higher expense quarter, a lot of variable expenses. Where we're at today? The September quarter is typically a lower expense quarter for us although we did have the one-time expenses. So that said, I would -- I think it's good to build a base from perhaps the September quarter. Again, there are a fair amount of variable expenses so as the business grows there are some variable ones that will grow with it. So I think starting with this September quarter and then building your growth from there.\\nSteve Moss -- B Riley, FBR -- Analyst\\nOkay. And lastly just on credit here, the reserve, underlying reservation I think looks like continues to build ex-tax, I would assume you would probably have one last leg up with accretion runoff here this quarter. Just kind of your thoughts around credit costs for the upcoming quarters as the allowance normalizes?\\nGlen Herrick -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes, we feel, as Brad mentioned, we feel good about our position in our allowance today. I think it'll depend on the mix of our assets, but you can assume that we'll probably end up around 100 basis points or so or a little higher actually, blended allowance, again, depending where the mix comes from and we'll build provision to maintain that level.\\nOperator\\nAnd our next question comes from Daniel Cardenas with Raymond James. Your line is open\\nDaniel Cardenas -- Raymond James -- Analyst\\nA Good afternoon, guys, just a couple of follow-up questions on the credit side. Any color you can provide in terms of the performance of your classified assets, say, versus the quarter before the previous quarter?\\nBrad Hanson -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYes. Well, we have the one more year. That's still out there that we're actively marketing and hope to make good progress on that here in early fiscal year '20. That actually represents like half of our nonperforming assets. The remainder we feel pretty good about their collateral position, gets a little lumpy just depending on when certain loans might age, especially, in the commercial finance portfolio, but overall, we feel very good about our credit position today.\\nDaniel Cardenas -- Raymond James -- Analyst\\nAll right. And how about watch list trends and how did those look in the quarter?\\nGlen Herrick -- Chief Financial Officer\\nAll of our trends in the commercial credit are -- we feel very positive and strong. We don't have any concerns there right now.\\nDaniel Cardenas -- Raymond James -- Analyst\\nOkay\\nOperator\\nAnd that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back to CEO, Brad Hanson.\\nBrad Hanson -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThanks. I'd like to close by thanking everybody for participating in Meta's quarterly investor call. We t  question comes from Michael Perito with KBW.\\nMichael Perito -- KBW -- Analyst\\nHey, good afternoon, everybody. And, Mike, I wanted to ask a kind of a big picture question on capital here. Obviously, after the stronger level in the third quarter, the repurchase has slowed a bit in the fourth quarter and the shares have obviously done quite well with bringing your multiple up, but obviously no rush around this because your capital levels are healthy today, but I wouldn't say anything major, but in the comp plans as I look forward, obviously, you guys are motivated to keep your balance sheet under $10 billion, which can somewhat limit the capital you need for balance sheet growth anyway and I'm just wondering how do you guys think about -- as your business matures and becomes more profitable with maybe a lower percentage growth rate, the capital you return to shareholders would seem like the level of buybacks you've done recently isn't sustainable longer-term, just curious how you guys are thinking about that dynamic as you evolve here.\\nGlen Herrick -- Chief Financial Officer\\nWell, as we stated, we expect to generate excess capital in 2020 and beyond, and we will certainly consider repurchase activity within the context of overall capital management as the board and management reviews our options.\\nMichael Perito -- KBW -- Analyst\\nAt any point does the dividend come into play or is that really...\\nGlen Herrick -- Chief Financial Officer\\nIt's certainly one of the levers -- yes, again, it's certainly one of the levers that the company will consider.\\nMichael Perito -- KBW -- Analyst\\nOkay. As we pick out the card fee line on the P side, it was a bit lower than it's been for quite some time now but I know it's an area of focus, just any unusual followups or expectations about that line item as we move forward and what you guys think is realistic, is there any other volatility expected near-term or is there something -- or is there a pipeline for growth. Just curious if you could provide us some more thoughts there.\\nBrad Hanson -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nWant to start?\\nGlen Herrick -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes, so we're kind of coming off this tough comparison because of the 1 times, that's from comparing FY '19 to fiscal year '18. That fiscal year '20 will be clean comparisons going forward. So we would expect this last quarter to be a low point in card fee income and that we will leg up from here. A number of our large programs are customized price. Depending on where the economics may fall and the characteristics of the deposits, how stable they are, they may be more seasonal. And so that all drives your card fee income. There are some tier pricings for some of our larger customers as they cross thresholds. So card fee income is an important driver of revenue for us, but overall, I would expect it to grow out at a slightly -- I expect it to grow from here, expected to grow at a slightly slower pace than overall deposit growth from the Payments business.\\nBrad Hanson -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nAnd you might note that some of the card fee income has transferred into the deposit fee line. So you need to take that into account as well and then finally as I've mentioned in my remarks, we are starting to evolve several new lines areas of business in merchant acquiring, our ACH origination which we have been involved in the past and our faster payments initiatives, which will all be more fee income based products. So those over the course of the next year and the year after, will start to have a more meaningful impact.\\nMichael Perito -- KBW -- Analyst\\nHelpful. And then just lastly, as we think about obviously, the card issuing you guys have done in the prepaid space, you've done really well. You start to see some of your competitors branch out to non -- like prepaid card program managers like banks like, well, they are not really banks, but partner companies like Chime and things of that nature. I'm just curious if you could kind of flush out a little bit for us, where your heads are at in terms of kind of   question comes from Michael Perito with KBW.\\nMichael Perito -- KBW -- Analyst\\nHey, good afternoon, everybody.

For fiscal 2019, Meta reported GAAP net income of $97 million or $2.49 per diluted share, one of several key accomplishments made during the year. This includes the previously announced executive transition expense of $0.12 per diluted share after-tax incurred in the fiscal second quarter and severance expenses of $0.07 per diluted share after-tax incurred in the fourth fiscal quarter as part of our initiative to optimize organizational resources and improve efficiency ratios. These results reflect the earnings power of the company and the impact our key initiatives are having on the business. Before I turn it over to Glenn for detailed account of the financial results, I'd like to take a bit more time to talk about the progress we are making on our key initiatives, increasing core deposits, improving our earning asset mix, and improving our efficiency ratio.\\nFirst, we work to accelerate the positive growth within our payments division by increasing business development efforts and streamlining processes making it easier for us strategic partners to do business with us. We were rewarded by the renewal and extension of existing relationships while also developing several new relationships. During fiscal 2019, average deposits from our Payments division grew 11% over the average for the fiscal year 2018. At the same time, we are positioning ourselves to take advantage of fee income opportunities in areas such as merchant acquiring, ACH origination and our faster Payments initiatives. Second, we are improving our interest earnings asset mix by replacing lower yielding loans and investment securities with higher yielding commercial loans, while maintaining a strong credit profile.\\nAs shown on Slide four of our investor presentation, quarterly average commercial finance loans accounted for 36% of our total earnings assets as of September 30, 2019, up from 23% at September 30, 2018, while investments as of September 30, 2019, made up just 28% of our earning assets compared to 46% at the end of September of last year. As a result, we generated growth in net interest income and expanded our net interest margin 90 basis points to 4.95% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to 4.05% in the comparable prior year quarter. Finally, we made meaningful strides in improving operating efficiencies across our organization as part of these efforts our strategic plan included a comprehensive analysis of our organizational structure and infrastructure. Following our review, we recently made the decision to outsource part of our IT infrastructure.\\nAs our business continues to grow so do the IT needs of our customers, partners and employees.

Finally, let me discuss an update to our previously disclosed earnings per share outlook. For fiscal year 2020, we are tightening our GAAP earnings per share guidance range to be between $3.30 and $3.50 per share. This represents a range of annual earnings-per-share growth from 33% to 41%. The title range reflects better visibility into revenue and expense trajectories, particularly, in light of a meaningfully different interest rate backdrop, since we initially provided an outlook for fiscal 2020 back in September 2018.\\nWith that, I'll turn the conversation back to Brad for closing comments.\\nBrad Hanson -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you, Glen. To recap, we are pleased with our results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year of 2019. The progress we have made thus far toward our 3 key initiatives and the opportunities in 2020. That completes our prepared remarks. So I'll ask Glen to join me for Q&A. Operator?\\nQuestions and Answers:\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Frank Schiraldi with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.\\nFrank Schiraldi -- Sandler O'Neill -- Analyst\\nTo start Just -- I wanted to ask about, well, first on the severance. Can you just talk a little bit about, is this -- you mentioned -- Brad, you mentioned the outsourcing your IT infrastructure, is that where this sort of severance is coming from? Or is this just sort of across positions?\\nBrad Hanson -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nWe had an initiative to look at all the positions in the company and make sure that positions were aligned with the needs of our strategic plan going forward and where we found gaps or positions that were not necessary or aligned, we eliminated certain positions and there were several people that were impacted by that process. As far as the IT transition goes, that will happen a little bit later. We -- The people that were in our IT department will be absorbed by the outsourcing company. So they will continue to be working here with us, but for the most part, they were not impacted by the severance.\\nFrank Schiraldi -- Sandler O'Neill -- Analyst\\nAnd is there any detail you can give on as you make that transition, impact to the income statement?\\nBrad Hanson -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nWell, we are looking for a positive impact over time. There is a transition period that will occur and it's primarily in the commodity base parts of the IT infrastructure business.\\nFrank Schiraldi -- Sandler O'Neill -- Analyst\\nOkay, and then just on the consumer loan balances, you transferred some to for sale, you mentioned obviously, the held for investment balances sell linked quarter. Just wondering, it didn't look like from your slide that you're further deemphasizing that business, but are you looking to shrink that portfolio? Or keep it stable at these levels?\\nBrad Hanson -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nNo, as we have mentioned, we plan to manage the consumer lending business to be within 15% of our earning assets. That's still our plan going forward, but we are taking a very measured approach as we develop those programs and portfolios to make sure that our infrastructure and capacity to manage them appropriately, especially, going into this part of the credit cycle is very sound.\\nFrank Schiraldi -- Sandler O'Neill -- Analyst\\nOkay, and then just one more and I'll go back into the queue. Just in terms of, obviously, people talk about we're getting later in the economic cycle here, some players tend to pull back from things like factoring and asset-backed lending at those times. I assume or believe it's not the plan for Crestmark. I'm just wondering if that maybe has created or is creating more opportunity for you and you could maybe just, any sort of color you can give on expected or anticipated growth rate in the Crestmark bu 23% at September 30, 2018, while investments as of September 30, 2019, made up just 28% of our earning assets compared to 46% at the end of September of last year.

Today we are pleased to report our results for the fourth fiscal quarter and full fiscal year 2019. On a GAAP basis, we generated net income of $20.2 million for the quarter or $0.53 per diluted share and $97 million or $2.49 per diluted share for the year. Full-year earnings-per-share growth of 49% over the prior year primarily reflected higher net interest income as a result of the Crestmark acquisition and efforts to optimize the mix of our balance sheet. Over the past year, we continued to build out our commercial finance portfolio and work toward improving our funding mix. Furthermore, we originated $104 million in solar leases during the year which related investment tax credits driving higher after-tax income. Though the timing and impact of future investment tax credits are expected to vary from period to period, we expect the tax rate for fiscal year 2020 to settle in the low teens.\\nTurning to the balance sheet, average interest-earning assets remained relatively flat on a linked quarter basis reflecting efforts to focus on enhancing our earnings asset mix instead of balance sheet growth. During the fourth quarter, we selectively sold lower yielding investment securities reducing our average holdings by 10% on a linked quarter basis and replaced them with higher-yielding loans primarily within our commercial finance portfolio. Total gross 23% at September 30, 2018, while investments as of September 30, 2019, made up just 28% of our earning assets compared to 46% at the end of September of last year. As a result, we generated growth in net interest income and expanded our net interest margin 90 basis points to 4.95% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to 4.05% in the comparable prior year quarter.

Your line is open.\\nFrank Schiraldi -- Sandler O'Neill -- Analyst\\nTo start Just -- I wanted to ask about, well, first on the severance. Can you just talk a little bit about, is this -- you mentioned -- Brad, you mentioned the outsourcing your IT infrastructure, is that where this sort of severance is coming from? Or is this just sort of across positions?\\nBrad Hanson -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nWe had an initiative to look at all the positions in the company and make sure that positions were aligned with the needs of our strategic plan going forward and where we found gaps or positions that were not necessary or aligned, we eliminated certain positions and there were several people that were impacted by that process. As far as the IT transition goes, that will happen a little bit later. We -- The people that were in our IT department will be absorbed by the outsourcing company. So they will continue to be working here with us, but for the most part, they were not impacted by the severance.\\nFrank Schiraldi -- Sandler O'Neill -- Analyst\\nAnd is there any detail you can give on as you make that transition, impact to the income statement?\\nBrad Hanson -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nWell, we are looking for a positive impact over time. There is a transition period that will occur and it's primarily in the commodity base parts of the IT infrastructure business.\\nFrank Schiraldi -- Sandler O'Neill -- Analyst\\nOkay, and then just on the consumer loan balances, you transferred some to for sale, you mentioned obviously, the held for investment balances sell linked quarter. Just wondering, it didn't look like from your slide that you're further deemphasizing that business, but are you looking to shrink that portfolio? Or keep it stable at these levels?\\nBrad Hanson -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nNo, as we have mentioned, we plan to manage the consumer lending business to be within 15% of our earning assets. That's still our plan going forward, but we are taking a very measured approach as we develop those programs and portfolios to make sure that our infrastructure and capacity to manage them appropriately, especially, going into this part of the credit cycle is very sound.\\nFrank Schiraldi -- Sandler O'Neill -- Analyst\\nOkay, and then just one more and I'll go back into the queue. Just in terms of, obviously, people talk about we're getting later in the economic cycle here, some players tend to pull back from things like factoring and asset-backed lending at those times. I assume or believe it's not the plan for Crestmark. I'm just wondering if that maybe has created or is creating more opportunity for you and you could maybe just, any sort of color you can give on expected or anticipated growth rate in the Crestmark bu y and equipment and loan and lease expenses primarily related to the Crestmark merger. From a cost efficiency perspective, we are committed to allocating capital and resources to businesses with the most attractive growth and profitability profiles. Finally, let me discuss an update to our previously disclosed earnings per share outlook. For fiscal year 2020, we are tightening our GAAP earnings per share guidance range to be between $3.30 and $3.50 per share. This represents a range of annual earnings-per-share growth from 33% to 41%. The title range reflects better visibility into revenue and expense trajectories, particularly, in light of a meaningfully different interest rate backdrop, since we initially provided an outlook for fiscal 2020 back in September 2018.\\nWith that, I'll turn the conversation back to Brad for closing comments.\\nBrad Hanson -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you, Glen. To recap, we are pleased with our results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year of 2019. The progress we have made thus far toward our 3 key initiatives and the opportunities in 2020. That completes our prepared remarks. So I'll ask Glen to join me for Q&A.

I assume or believe it's not the plan for Crestmark. I'm just wondering if that maybe has created or is creating more opportunity for you and you could maybe just, any sort of color you can give on expected or anticipated growth rate in the Crestmark bu  loans and leases were $3.65 billion at September 30, again, relatively flat on a linked quarter basis despite the seasonal runoff of tax related loans and the transfer of certain consumer loan products held for sale and up 24% from September 30, 2018. Our commercial finance portfolio was $1.92 billion at September 30, an increase of 4% on a linked quarter basis and 27% year-over-year meaningfully outperforming our initial 15% forecast for loan growth at the time of the merger.\\nOn Slide seven, we provide more color on the components of our commercial finance portfolio, for example, our asset-based lending portfolio average loan size was approximately $775,000 and average yield was 9.67% for the quarter and the approximate net charge-off rate was 60 basis points over the past three years. Turning to the liabilities side of the balance sheet, average payments deposits grew by 11% compared to the same quarter in the prior fiscal year and represented 57% of total average deposits. As a result of the balance sheet remix, we generated $65.6 million of net interest income in the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter, up 35% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, while our net interest margin expanded by 90 basis points year-over-year to 4.95% for the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter. Purchase accounting accretion contributed 14 basis points to the net interest margin in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, a decrease of 11 basis points from the third quarter, and we expect minimal contribution in fiscal 2020 as adjustments related to the purchase loan and lease portfolio from Crestmark are expected to wind down. Loan yields were 7.51% for the quarter compared to 7.77% for the previous quarter and 7.21% for the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year.\\nPurchase accounting accretion added 20 basis points to loan yields in the fourth quarter versus 37 basis points in the third quarter. Meta's provision for loan and lease losses was $4.1 million for the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter compared to $4.7 million for the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year. The decline in provision was primarily driven by a decrease in loan balances within the consumer loan portfolio as well as the lower provision in the tax services and Community Bank portfolios. Net charge-offs were $18.5 million for the quarter, which included $15.4 million related to charging off the majority of the remaining balances of tax service loans. Our credit metrics remain within our risk tolerance level as depicted on Slide eight of the investor deck. Nonperforming assets represented 91 basis points of the company's total assets at September 30. Of note, foreclosed real estate and repossessed assets represented 48 basis points of the company's nonperforming assets balance at September 30, 2019, which is primarily related to a nonperforming agricultural relationship that we have previously discussed.\\nWe continue to evaluate liquidation options the nonperforming ag relationship as it is actively being marketed for sale. The entries in nonperforming assets compared to the linked quarter was primarily attributable to a couple of relationships in the commercial finance portfolio where occasional fluctuations are common. Noninterest income was $36 million for the fiscal fourth quarter, up $11.4 million from the same quarter of fiscal 2018. For the year, noninterest income totaled $222 million, up $38 million from fiscal 2018 and represented 46% of total revenues. The year-over-year increase was largely driven by increases in rental income, gain on sale of securities, gain on sale of loans and leases, and other income. Turning to noninterest expense, as Brad previously mentioned, we remain focused on positioning the company to maximize profitable growth going forward.\\nAs a result, we incurred $3.5 million of expense during the quarter related to organizational changes, primarily severance to better support growth and drive enhanced operating leverage. Other fiscal year-over-year drivers of noninterest expense included step-ups in compensation, operating lease equipment depreciation, occupanc  loans and leases were $3.65 billion at September 30, again, relatively flat on a linked quarter basis despite the seasonal runoff of tax related loans and the transfer of certain consumer loan products held for sale and up 24% from September 30, 2018.

We are in support of those kinds of products.\\nMichael Perito -- KBW -- Analyst\\nOkay, so I guess more to come in and stay tuned?\\nGlen Herrick -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes.\\nBrad Hanson -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYes. We are certainly involved and as payments evolves and we'll partner with strong relationships where we find them. I would note, Mike, overall our total fee income represented roughly 45%, 46% of overall revenues and we would hope it would stay at that level or be a higher percentage actually in 2020.\\nMichael Perito -- KBW -- Analyst\\nGreat, well, all helpful. Thank you guys for the color. I appreciate it.\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Steve Moss with B. Riley FBR. Your line is open.\\nSteve Moss -- B Riley, FBR -- Analyst\\nI want to start on the commercial finance yields, they are down about 65 basis points or so quarter-over-quarter. Just wondering what the underlying dynamics were there for the quarter and how we should think about that going forward?\\nBrad Hanson -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nWell, we had a leg down in the purchase accretion, which contributed to that. There are a fair amount of variable rate loan products in that portfolio and then it's just a mix of somewhat of a mix shift, some portfolios in commercial finance are growing faster than others.\\nSteve Moss -- B Riley, FBR -- Analyst\\nIn terms of the variable rate, roughly what idea percentage is variable within a portfolio. I know the Premium Finances, for example?\\nBrad Hanson -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nIt is about 40%, roughly plus or minus. Yes.\\nSteve Moss -- B Riley, FBR -- Analyst\\nAnd then as we think about the margin going forward, I would assume that you're going to pick up in commercial plans growth here in the upcoming quarter. Just kind of thinking about the different drivers you do have obviously, lower rates what you should probably be getting funding benefits. Just any color on the margin would be great.\\nBrad Hanson -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYes, we had a step down this quarter in accretion. Next quarter will be our final big step down in accretion. So I would expect margin to increase a little bit. The mix shift will help offset the accretion that will run off and so we should be flat to up a few basis points next quarter and then start legging up through the rest of 2020.\\nSteve Moss -- B Riley, FBR -- Analyst\\nOkay, that's helpful. And then on expenses, just wanted to circle back to that. Wondering what is a cleaner run rate going forward with the cost saves that were disclosed here?\\nGlen Herrick -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes, so I'll get to your question specifically, but as you know, we have a fair amount of seasonality in our run rate's, primarily, taxes and it kicks up here in December and then runs through March, first part of April. So certainly the March quarter is always a higher expense quarter, a lot of variable expenses. Where we're at today? The September quarter is typically a lower expense quarter for us although we did have the one-time expenses. So that said, I would -- I think it's good to build a base from perhaps the September quarter. Again, there are a fair amount of variable expenses so as the business grows there are some variable ones that will grow with it. So I think starting with this September quarter and then building your growth from there.\\nSteve Moss -- B Riley, FBR -- Analyst\\nOkay. And lastly just on credit here, the reserve, underlying reservation I think looks like continues to build ex-tax, I would assume you would probably have o expanding the ability to white label our card issue, your banking services and what we can kind of expect because it seems like a big priority for the next couple of years what we can kind of expect to see on that front moving forward.\\nGlen Herrick -- Chief Financial Officer\\nAnd that's why you seen some of the fee income, card fee income move into the deposit fee line, because several of our partners and new relationships are involved with those exact type of products you're discussing.

And lastly just on credit here, the reserve, underlying reservation I think looks like continues to build ex-tax, I would assume you would probably have o siness from here.\\nBrad Hanson -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nWe have been consistent in saying, as we looked at the Crestmark performance over the prior years that their performance is sound during times of downturns as well as up cycles. As we see competition and people stretching in areas to compromise on structure and pricing, we try to remain very disciplined in that and then over time we believe that it will create opportunities for us.\\nFrank Schiraldi -- Sandler O'Neill -- Analyst\\nI mean, do you expect that business to continue to grow in the double digits? Or what's a decent growth rate, I guess?\\nGlen Herrick -- Chief Financial Officer\\nFrank, this is Glen. Certainly as the denominator becomes larger, we would expect to see some slowing of growth, but we are expecting double-digit growth year-over-year and it could come from different levers there. We have a broad set of products to serve our customers and I would also just -- to add on some color to Brad's comments about the credit cycle, also point you to the -- not all factory and an asset based lending are created equal and while the portfolios that we have are certainly higher return portfolios than our traditional community bank portfolios, they are also not the high cost -- the higher cost factoring or ABL type products, they are a little lower in the credit quality range.\\nFrank Schiraldi -- Sandler O'Neill -- Analyst\\nOkay, I'm sorry, you said they are lower in terms of the factoring as well?\\nGlen Herrick -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. So, let's say we are -- we've got yields of 9.7% for a portfolio and as you go down in credit quality there may be other players in those that do factoring or ABL that are charging 18% to 20% to 36%. And that's usually the reflection of the credit quality or the credit risk inherent in the customers they are serving. So there's a lot of different flavors of the commercial finance business.\\nFrank Schiraldi -- Sandler O'Neill -- Analyst\\nOkay. All right. I appreciate it. Thanks.\\nOperator\\nThank you, and our next question comes from Michael Perito with KBW.\\nMichael Perito -- KBW -- Analyst\\nHey, good afternoon, everybody. And, Mike, I wanted to ask a kind of a big picture question on capital here. Obviously, after the stronger level in the third quarter, the repurchase has slowed a bit in the fourth quarter and the shares have obviously done quite well with bringing your multiple up, but obviously no rush around this because your capital levels are healthy today, but I wouldn't say anything major, but in the comp plans as I look forward, obviously, you guys are motivated to keep your balance sheet under $10 billion, which can somewhat limit the capital you need for balance sheet growth anyway and I'm just wondering how do you guys think about -- as your business matures and becomes more profitable with maybe a lower percentage growth rate, the capital you return to shareholders would seem like the level of buybacks you've done recently isn't sustainable longer-term, just curious how you guys are thinking about that dynamic as you evolve here.\\nGlen Herrick -- Chief Financial Officer\\nWell, as we stated, we expect to generate excess capital in 2020 and beyond, and we will certainly consider repurchase activity within the context of overall capital management as the board and management reviews our options.\\nMichael Perito -- KBW -- Analyst\\nAt any point does the dividend come into play or is that really...\\nGlen Herrick -- Chief Financial Officer\\nIt's certainly one of the levers -- yes, again, it's certainly one of the levers that the company will consider.\\nMichael Perito -- KBW -- Analyst\\nOkay. As we pick out the card fee line on the P side, it was a bit lower than it's been for quite some time now but I know it's an area of focus, just any unusual followups or expectations about that line item as we move forward and what you guys think is realistic, is there any other volatility expected near-term or is there something -- or is there a pipeline for growth. Just curious if you could provide us some more thoughts there.\\nBrad Ha siness from here.\\nBrad Hanson -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nWe have been consistent in saying, as we looked at the Crestmark performance over the prior years that their performance is sound during times of downturns as well as up cycles. As we see competition and people stretching in areas to compromise on structure and pricing, we try to remain very disciplined in that and then over time we believe that it will create opportunities for us.\\nFrank Schiraldi -- Sandler O'Neill -- Analyst\\nI mean, do you expect that business to continue to grow in the double digits? Or what's a decent growth rate, I guess?\\nGlen Herrick -- Chief Financial Officer\\nFrank, this is Glen. Certainly as the denominator becomes larger, we would expect to see some slowing of growth, but we are expecting double-digit growth year-over-year and it could come from different levers there. We have a broad set of products to serve our customers and I would also just -- to add on some color to Brad's comments about the credit cycle, also point you to the -- not all factory and an asset based lending are created equal and while the portfolios that we have are certainly higher return portfolios than our traditional community bank portfolios, they are also not the high cost -- the higher cost factoring or ABL type products, they are a little lower in the credit quality range.\\nFrank Schiraldi -- Sandler O'Neill -- Analyst\\nOkay, I'm sorry, you said they are lower in terms of the factoring as well?\\nGlen Herrick -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. So, let's say we are -- we've got yields of 9.7% for a portfolio and as you go down in credit quality there may be other players in those that do factoring or ABL that are charging 18% to 20% to 36%. And that's usually the reflection of the credit quality or the credit risk inherent in the customers they are serving. So there's a lot of different flavors of the commercial finance business.\\nFrank Schiraldi -- Sandler O'Neill -- Analyst\\nOkay. All right. I appreciate it.

Just curious if you could provide us some more thoughts there.\\nBrad Ha ne last leg up with accretion runoff here this quarter. Just kind of your thoughts around credit costs for the upcoming quarters as the allowance normalizes?\\nGlen Herrick -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes, we feel, as Brad mentioned, we feel good about our position in our allowance today. I think it'll depend on the mix of our assets, but you can assume that we'll probably end up around 100 basis points or so or a little higher actually, blended allowance, again, depending where the mix comes from and we'll build provision to maintain that level.\\nOperator\\nAnd our next question comes from Daniel Cardenas with Raymond James. Your line is open\\nDaniel Cardenas -- Raymond James -- Analyst\\nA Good afternoon, guys, just a couple of follow-up questions on the credit side. Any color you can provide in terms of the performance of your classified assets, say, versus the quarter before the previous quarter?\\nBrad Hanson -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYes. Well, we have the one more year. That's still out there that we're actively marketing and hope to make good progress on that here in early fiscal year '20. That actually represents like half of our nonperforming assets. The remainder we feel pretty good about their collateral position, gets a little lumpy just depending on when certain loans might age, especially, in the commercial finance portfolio, but overall, we feel very good about our credit position today.\\nDaniel Cardenas -- Raymond James -- Analyst\\nAll right. And how about watch list trends and how did those look in the quarter?\\nGlen Herrick -- Chief Financial Officer\\nAll of our trends in the commercial credit are -- we feel very positive and strong. We don't have any concerns there right now.\\nDaniel Cardenas -- Raymond James -- Analyst\\nOkay\\nOperator\\nAnd that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back to CEO, Brad Hanson.\\nBrad Hanson -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThanks. I'd like to close by thanking everybody for participating in Meta's quarterly investor call. We truly appreciate your support, and thank you for taking time to listen to us today. Have a great evening.\\nOperator\\n[Operator Closing Remarks]\\nDuration: 35 minutes\\nCall participants:\\nBrittany Elsasser -- Director of Investor Relations\\nBrad Hanson -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nGlen Herrick -- Chief Financial Officer\\nFrank Schiraldi -- Sandler O'Neill -- Analyst\\nMichael Perito -- KBW -- Analyst\\nSteve Moss -- B Riley, FBR -- Analyst\\nDaniel Cardenas -- Raymond James -- Analyst\\nMore CASH analysis\\nAll earnings call transcripts\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Executive Officer\\nIt is about 40%, roughly plus or minus. Yes.\\nSteve Moss -- B Riley, FBR -- Analyst\\nAnd then as we think about the margin going forward, I would assume that you're going to pick up in commercial plans growth here in the upcoming quarter. Just kind of thinking about the different drivers you do have obviously, lower rates what you should probably be getting funding benefits. Just any color on the margin would be great.\\nBrad Hanson -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYes, we had a step down this quarter in accretion. Next quarter will be our final big step down in accretion. So I would expect margin to increase a little bit. The mix shift will help offset the accretion that will run off and so we should be flat to up a few basis points next quarter and then start legging up through the rest of 2020.\\nSteve Moss -- B Riley, FBR -- Analyst\\nOkay, that's helpful. And then on expenses, just wanted to circle back to that. Wondering what is a cleaner run rate going forward with the cost saves that were disclosed here?\\nGlen Herrick -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes, so I'll get to your question specifically, but as you know, we have a fair amount of seasonality in our run rate's, primarily, taxes and it kicks up here in December and then runs through March, first part of April. So certainly the March quarter is always a higher expense quarter, a lot of variable expenses. Where we're at today? The September quarter is typically a lower expense quarter for us although we did have the one-time expenses. So that said, I would -- I think it's good to build a base from perhaps the September quarter. Again, there are a fair amount of variable expenses so as the business grows there are some variable ones that will grow with it. So I think starting with this September quarter and then building your growth from there.\\nSteve Moss -- B Riley, FBR -- Analyst\\nOkay. And lastly just on credit here, the reserve, underlying reservation I think looks like continues to build ex-tax, I would assume you would probably have one last leg up with accretion runoff here this quarter. Just kind of your thoughts around credit costs for the upcoming quarters as the allowance normalizes?\\nGlen Herrick -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes, we feel, as Brad mentioned, we feel good about our position in our allowance today. I think it'll depend on the mix of our assets, but you can assume that we'll probably end up around 100 basis points or so or a little higher actually, blended allowance, again, depending where the mix comes from and we'll build provision to maintain that level.\\nOperator\\nAnd our next question comes from Daniel Cardenas with Raymond James.

I will now turn the call back to CEO, Brad Hanson.\\nBrad Hanson -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThanks. I'd like to close by thanking everybody for participating in Meta's quarterly investor call. We t 23% at September 30, 2018, while investments as of September 30, 2019, made up just 28% of our earning assets compared to 46% at the end of September of last year. As a result, we generated growth in net interest income and expanded our net interest margin 90 basis points to 4.95% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to 4.05% in the comparable prior year quarter. Finally, we made meaningful strides in improving operating efficiencies across our organization as part of these efforts our strategic plan included a comprehensive analysis of our organizational structure and infrastructure. Following our review, we recently made the decision to outsource part of our IT infrastructure.\\nAs our business continues to grow so do the IT needs of our customers, partners and employees. We determined that we need to meet those needs in a quicker and more efficient manner and better align our resources with our strategic growth priorities for transitioning certain nonproprietary commoditized functions to an external IT focused firm. More proprietary strategic functions including IT development will remain in house. We also made a significant organizational changes in the fourth quarter to begin aligning positions and resources with our strategic objectives, while continuing to improve operating efficiencies. As we head into fiscal 2020, we remain focused on optimizing our organization and developing a strong foundation for further growth.\\nWe will continue to focus on allocating the appropriate resources to areas that maximize value for the company and our shareholders over time. Turning to capital management. During the fiscal fourth quarter, we opportunistically bought back approximately 106,000 shares under our existing share repurchase authorization, bringing total repurchases to approximately 1.7 million shares for the fiscal year. We remain opportunistic and will consider repurchase activity within the context of a balanced capital management approach designed to support the company's growth prospects and maximize shareholder value. While fiscal 2019 marked a year of significant change in progress, we believe there is much more to come in furtherance of our key strategic initiatives as we continue to execute on the key pillars of our plan, while providing tailored services for our customers, opportunities for our employees and driving more value for shareholders, and we believe our execution will allow us to deliver significant earnings growth in the year ahead.\\nNow let me turn it over to Glen Herrick, our CFO, to provide a review of our fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal 2019 financial results.\\nGlen Herrick -- Chief Financial Officer\\nThank you, Brad, and good afternoon, everyone. Today we are pleased to report our results for the fourth fiscal quarter and full fiscal year 2019. On a GAAP basis, we generated net income of $20.2 million for the quarter or $0.53 per diluted share and $97 million or $2.49 per diluted share for the year. Full-year earnings-per-share growth of 49% over the prior year primarily reflected higher net interest income as a result of the Crestmark acquisition and efforts to optimize the mix of our balance sheet. Over the past year, we continued to build out our commercial finance portfolio and work toward improving our funding mix. Furthermore, we originated $104 million in solar leases during the year which related investment tax credits driving higher after-tax income. Though the timing and impact of future investment tax credits are expected to vary from period to period, we expect the tax rate for fiscal year 2020 to settle in the low teens.\\nTurning to the balance sheet, average interest-earning assets remained relatively flat on a linked quarter basis reflecting efforts to focus on enhancing our earnings asset mix instead of balance sheet growth. During the fourth quarter, we selectively sold lower yielding investment securities reducing our average holdings by 10% on a linked quarter basis and replaced them with higher-yielding loans primarily within our commercial finance portfolio. Total gross\",\n          \"y after several weeks of downtime. Obviously, volumes are down from the record highs of the previous years, but there is resiliency there more than some would have predicted. The global off-highway markets have restarted because we restarted across the board with varying run rates depending on the region and the end markets. We continue to see stronger demand in agriculture and weaker demand in construction.\\nAnd as I stated earlier, our aftermarket business continues to operate uninterrupted. As you can imagine, with different end markets ramping up production at different rates, cohesively and consistently executing a very robust global operational and supply chain management system is essential to success. The Dana operational purchasing and supply chain management team did a remarkable job navigating through the ebbs and flows of the dramatic customer requirement changes. And of course, this was not only on a country-by-country basis as the pandemic altered manufacturing around the world, but often on a state-by-state or providence-by-providence basis. Drawing your attention to the center of the page, customer engagement may have slowed for a brief period of time. But today, we are back, albeit in its new normal of digital communications where we left off pre-COVID. Customer satisfaction starts with having great people who have a tremendous passion for creating value for our customers. At Dana, customer satisfaction is in our DNA, and the team is executing product design reviews, product validation testing, launch readiness reviews and all other facets of the business.\\nMost importantly, we are all doing this safely. As you will notice on the right-hand side of the page, coincide with the new normal, we have thoughtfully, not only increased safety protocols in our operations in many ways, we clearly understand that the new normal work environment could result in any manufacturing company deviating away from standardized operating processes. Accordingly, we have also elevated our focus on quality to be more proactive than ever as our operating challenges are required in the manufacturing environment. For example, as we adjusted shop floor operations to support social distancing protocols, we have ensured that all processes are revalidated to ensure that product and process characteristics meet our customers' requirements. Of course, this much translates over into new product launches as illustrated in the bottom right-hand corner of the page. We continue to see minimal delays in new product launches for future programs. Furthermore, to continue the steady stream of new product launches in the future, we continue to make investments in new product technology to support our customers' needs as they move from internal-combustion engine to electrified vehicles, which will drive growth across the businesses we serve. Now turning to slide six. I'd like to share some exciting news about another new electrification program we are working on. Our customers continue to recognize a strong value proposition for turnkey suppliers with full e-Powertrain capabilities. I will briefly remind the audience that what I mean by complete e-Powertrain capabilities. As you can see in the bottom left-hand side of the page, Dana, of course, has the e-Propulsion system capabilities, including the motor, inverter and driveline. Moving to the right, we also provide power electronics and battery system to complete the full e-Powertrain system.\\nBy having all of these capabilities in house, Dana, including our e-thermal competency is the only supplier with complete e-Powertrain supply capability, thus enabling us to partner closely with our customers to provide optimized and efficient solutions to meet their needs. Specific to the presentation page and announcing the exciting new business award, we were recently sourced the e-Powertrain by a major European commercial truck manufacturer for a new battery electric medium-duty truck that will be used for urban and regional product distribution. The vehicle production is slated to start next year. The 0-e able assumption.\\nJoseph Beninati -- Oppenheimer -- Analyst\\nGot it. And then I guess, also, in the past quarter, we've seen quite a bit of attention on policy development and access to capital for hybrid fuel cell powertrains, particularly in commercial vehicles. So you guys have already supplied fuel cell stacks. But wondering if you see the opportunity or need going forward to expand your offerings in this area, similar to how you've done with EVs? And if so, where you'd like to focus your investments?\\nJames Kamsickas -- Chairman / Chief Executive Officer of Dana Incorporated\\nThanks for the question, Joe. I appreciate it very much. You never say never. You're right. Our experience in fuel cell is goes back decades as well. It certainly helps us be in the game relative to the full driveline solution or integration solution as we're working on many projects in that regard and especially in the commercial vehicle segment. To do more as it relates to the actual stack, that's not our intention. Right now, it's to support our customers like we have for years. But we'll see how that market continues to unfold. As you know, it's a little bit further out there, and a lot of folks are thinking about it, working on it. But we keep our ear to the ground and keep our technology road maps in place to be flexible.\\nJoseph Beninati -- Oppenheimer -- Analyst\\nSure. If I could just squeeze one more in, circling back on the product launches. You've announced a number of these wins for the fully integrated powertrain supply. Are those launches generally tracking time line-wise similar to your expectations?\\nAnd then second, can you talk a little bit about how you're managing the supply chain and make first-buy decisions for EV components, given the limited scale in the industry?\\nJames Kamsickas -- Chairman / Chief Executive Officer of Dana Incorporated\\nThanks again for the question. I would say, first of all, yes, they're tracking. As I said in previous calls, the way I would look at it, I think most people are there's a bit of a bubble for everybody in the world, whatever you want to pick, six, eight weeks. You could argue that launches are delayed a little bit by that amount, but that's not substantial anyway. Back to your supply chain piece of it, you're right. That's a good observation that you don't have as much history on that, but I don't think by accident that our acquisition and roll-up of various electrified assets out there, people that have been doing some form of electric vehicles and components for well over decades, such as obviously, TM4, Ashwoods. The list goes on, SME, etc, and even today's announcement on Rational Motion, the best of the best supply base they've worked with. We're working with them, and we're working off of that to build up the most sophisticated and robust supply chain we can.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from the line of James Picariello with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\\nJames Picariello -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst\\nHey, good morning guys.\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nGood morning.\\nJames Picariello -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst\\nIf we compare your cost structure next year to 2019 as a base, excluding any impact from acquisitions, is there a structural cost savings number we should be considering for 2021? Or would that maybe just be captured in a mid-20% incremental margin contribution?\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. At this point, we're not giving a specific number, but we would indicate that of structural cost actions taken in the second quarter. Some of them will be permanent. It won't be insignificant. So we do think it's going to be something that's going to help the margins be higher on the upswing or the incrementals to be higher than they would have been prior to that. So certainly, there's a combination. There are a number of temporary actions that we referred to, but there are some permanent ones as well there.

And as we get toward the end of the year and start providing an ou Prepared Remarks:\\nOperator\\nGood morning, and welcome to Dana Incorporated's Second Quarter 2020 Financial Webcast and Conference Call. My name is Carmen, and I will be your conference operator today. [Operator Instructions]\\nAt this time, I would like to begin the presentation by turning the call over to Dana's Senior Director of Investor Relations and Strategic Planning, Craig Barber. Please go ahead, Mr. Barber.\\nCraig Barber -- Senior Director of Investor Relations and Strategic Planning\\nThank you, Carmen, and good morning, everyone on the call. Thank you for joining us today for our second quarter of 2020 earnings call. You will find this morning's press release and presentation are now posted on our investor website. Today's call is being recorded and the supporting materials are the property of Dana Incorporated. They may not be recorded, copied or rebroadcast without our written consent. Allow me to remind you that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about our expectation for Dana's future performance. Actual results could differ from those suggested by our comments today. Additional information about the factors that could affect future results are summarized in our safe harbor statements found in our public filings and included with our reports with the SEC. On this call this morning is Jim Kamsickas, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jonathan Collins, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\\nThank you all. And Jim, the call is yours.\\nJames Kamsickas -- Chairman / Chief Executive Officer of Dana Incorporated\\nOkay. Thank you, Craig, and good morning, and thank all of you for joining us today. We hope that you and your families continue to remain safe throughout this difficult season. As you are aware, the mobility markets have seen a great deal of disruption in the first half of the year as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic. As we communicated at the end of the first quarter, a large percentage of customers idled some or all production in April, and we're not able to begin restarting production until May. The initial May production ramp-up in the U.S. and a few other countries was just a bit slower than we had expected. But since then, we've seen a steady increase in demand as nearly all of our customers are back online. As a direct result of the global shutdowns, sales for the second quarter were $1.1 billion, just over 50% decline from the second quarter last year. As depicted in the lower left side of the slide, April saw a majority of the shutdown impact. We saw an 83% improvement in May as operations began to restart and further an 84% improvement in June as demand continued to improve. Through a combination of cost management actions and efficiently restarting our operations, we ended the quarter with nearly breakeven adjusted EBITDA and a slight adjusted EPS loss.\\nDespite the challenges, we had several highlights in the second quarter as we pivoted to restarting and reengaging the business. To begin with, all our operations have safely and successfully reopened, and we continue to win new business, notably on new electric vehicle programs. We also continue to invest in EV growth through both targeted acquisitions of key capabilities and strategically partnering with industry leaders to bring new technologies to the market. But it's not just on hybrid and electric vehicle programs where Dana is growing. Perhaps you had a chance to virtually watch one of the most highly anticipated and exciting vehicle debuts of the year, the all-new Ford Bronco. The Dana brand is well-known to consumers in the off-road space because, for decades, we delivered the most durable and robust driveline products capable of handling the rugged terrain that these vehicles experience. In other words, with Dana, it's more than the products alone. It's also about brand loyalty and the consumer experience. Moving to slide five, I'd like to talk about how we've successfully restarted our operations. Starting in the left-hand third of the page, as you can imagine, restarting approximately 150 Prepared Remarks:\\nOperator\\nGood morning, and welcome to Dana Incorporated's Second Quarter 2020 Financial Webcast and Conference Call. My name is Carmen, and I will be your conference operator today. [Operator Instructions]\\nAt this time, I would like to begin the presentation by turning the call over to Dana's Senior Director of Investor Relations and Strategic Planning, Craig Barber. Please go ahead, Mr. Barber.\\nCraig Barber -- Senior Director of Investor Relations and Strategic Planning\\nThank you, Carmen, and good morning, everyone on the call. Thank you for joining us today for our second quarter of 2020 earnings call. You will find this morning's press release and presentation are now posted on our investor website. Today's call is being recorded and the supporting materials are the property of Dana Incorporated. They may not be recorded, copied or rebroadcast without our written consent. Allow me to remind you that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about our expectation for Dana's future performance. Actual results could differ from those suggested by our comments today. Additional information about the factors that could affect future results are summarized in our safe harbor statements found in our public filings and included with our reports with the SEC. On this call this morning is Jim Kamsickas, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jonathan Collins, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\\nThank you all. And Jim, the call is yours.\\nJames Kamsickas -- Chairman / Chief Executive Officer of Dana Incorporated\\nOkay. Thank you, Craig, and good morning, and thank all of you for joining us today. We hope that you and your families continue to remain safe throughout this difficult season. As you are aware, the mobility markets have seen a great deal of disruption in the first half of the year as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic. As we communicated at the end of the first quarter, a large percentage of customers idled some or all production in April, and we're not able to begin restarting production until May. The initial May production ramp-up in the U.S. and a few other countries was just a bit slower than we had expected. But since then, we've seen a steady increase in demand as nearly all of our customers are back online. As a direct result of the global shutdowns, sales for the second quarter were $1.1 billion, just over 50% decline from the second quarter last year. As depicted in the lower left side of the slide, April saw a majority of the shutdown impact. We saw an 83% improvement in May as operations began to restart and further an 84% improvement in June as demand continued to improve. Through a combination of cost management actions and efficiently restarting our operations, we ended the quarter with nearly breakeven adjusted EBITDA and a slight adjusted EPS loss.\\nDespite the challenges, we had several highlights in the second quarter as we pivoted to restarting and reengaging the business. To begin with, all our operations have safely and successfully reopened, and we continue to win new business, notably on new electric vehicle programs. We also continue to invest in EV growth through both targeted acquisitions of key capabilities and strategically partnering with industry leaders to bring new technologies to the market. But it's not just on hybrid and electric vehicle programs where Dana is growing. Perhaps you had a chance to virtually watch one of the most highly anticipated and exciting vehicle debuts of the year, the all-new Ford Bronco. The Dana brand is well-known to consumers in the off-road space because, for decades, we delivered the most durable and robust driveline products capable of handling the rugged terrain that these vehicles experience. In other words, with Dana, it's more than the products alone. It's also about brand loyalty and the consumer experience. Moving to slide five, I'd like to talk about how we've successfully restarted our operations. Starting in the left-hand third of the page, as you can imagine, restarting approximately 150 at it's all in-house. And Joel engineer talks to Suzi engineer talks to Tony engineer, and they find a way to get it done. And we think we find that many of our customers see it the same way. So it's a long-winded answer to your question, but that's about the best I can give you.\\nDan Levy -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\\nOkay. That's helpful. If I could just squeeze in one more. Just if you could, housekeeping, if you could provide some parameters on what you expect in working capital in the second half?\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. Similar with what we communicated with the breakeven analysis that we shared at the end of the first quarter, we were expecting this significant of a sales decline for working capital to be a substantial source of cash. It's really going to start to happen in the third quarter. So inventories came down late in the second quarter. That's going to convert to cash in the third quarter. So we would expect to have a significant generation of cash from working capital in the second half of the year and also on a full year basis.\\nDan Levy -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\\nOkay, great, thank you very much.\\nOperator\\nI have a Noah. Your line is open. If you're on mute please unmute your line.\\nJoseph Beninati -- Oppenheimer -- Analyst\\nIt's Joe on for Noah. Thanks for taking our questions this morning.. Just circling back on the decrementals. Are you expecting similar decrementals in 3Q as you saw in 2Q? And if so, that would imply 3Q EBITDA potentially more than $100 million. And I guess the decrementals raw material were sequentially. Can you just point to any puts and takes regarding that?\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nNo, I think as far as the decrementals are concerned, we shared the breakeven scenario at the end of last quarter. It implied full year decrementals in the mid-20s. So I think we expect to remain pretty close to that range on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter. So I think that's a pretty reasonable assumption.\\nJoseph Beninati -- Oppenheimer -- Analyst\\nGot it. And then I guess, also, in the past quarter, we've seen quite a bit of attention on policy development and access to capital for hybrid fuel cell powertrains, particularly in commercial vehicles. So you guys have already supplied fuel cell stacks. But wondering if you see the opportunity or need going forward to expand your offerings in this area, similar to how you've done with EVs? And if so, where you'd like to focus your investments?\\nJames Kamsickas -- Chairman / Chief Executive Officer of Dana Incorporated\\nThanks for the question, Joe. I appreciate it very much. You never say never. You're right. Our experience in fuel cell is goes back decades as well. It certainly helps us be in the game relative to the full driveline solution or integration solution as we're working on many projects in that regard and especially in the commercial vehicle segment. To do more as it relates to the actual stack, that's not our intention. Right now, it's to support our customers like we have for years. But we'll see how that market continues to unfold. As you know, it's a little bit further out there, and a lot of folks are thinking about it, working on it. But we keep our ear to the ground and keep our technology road maps in place to be flexible.\\nJoseph Beninati -- Oppenheimer -- Analyst\\nSure. If I could just squeeze one more in, circling back on the product launches. You've announced a number of these wins for the fully integrated powertrain supply. Are those launches generally tracking time line-wise similar to your expectations?\\nAnd then second, can you talk a little bit about how you're managing the supply chain and make first-buy decisions for EV components, given the limited scale in the industry?\\nJames Kamsickas -- Chairman / Chief Executive Officer of Dana Incorporated\\nThanks again for the question. I would say, first of all, yes, they're tracking. As I said in previous calls, the way I would look at it, I think most people are there's a bit of a bubb at it's all in-house. And Joel engineer talks to Suzi engineer talks to Tony engineer, and they find a way to get it done. And we think we find that many of our customers see it the same way.

We also continue to invest in EV growth through both targeted acquisitions of key capabilities and strategically partnering with industry leaders to bring new technologies to the market. But it's not just on hybrid and electric vehicle programs where Dana is growing. Perhaps you had a chance to virtually watch one of the most highly anticipated and exciting vehicle debuts of the year, the all-new Ford Bronco. The Dana brand is well-known to consumers in the off-road space because, for decades, we delivered the most durable and robust driveline products capable of handling the rugged terrain that these vehicles experience. In other words, with Dana, it's more than the products alone. It's also about brand loyalty and the consumer experience. Moving to slide five, I'd like to talk about how we've successfully restarted our operations. Starting in the left-hand third of the page, as you can imagine, restarting approximately 150 y after several weeks of downtime. Obviously, volumes are down from the record highs of the previous years, but there is resiliency there more than some would have predicted. The global off-highway markets have restarted because we restarted across the board with varying run rates depending on the region and the end markets. We continue to see stronger demand in agriculture and weaker demand in construction.\\nAnd as I stated earlier, our aftermarket business continues to operate uninterrupted. As you can imagine, with different end markets ramping up production at different rates, cohesively and consistently executing a very robust global operational and supply chain management system is essential to success. The Dana operational purchasing and supply chain management team did a remarkable job navigating through the ebbs and flows of the dramatic customer requirement changes. And of course, this was not only on a country-by-country basis as the pandemic altered manufacturing around the world, but often on a state-by-state or providence-by-providence basis. Drawing your attention to the center of the page, customer engagement may have slowed for a brief period of time. But today, we are back, albeit in its new normal of digital communications where we left off pre-COVID. Customer satisfaction starts with having great people who have a tremendous passion for creating value for our customers. At Dana, customer satisfaction is in our DNA, and the team is executing product design reviews, product validation testing, launch readiness reviews and all other facets of the business.\\nMost importantly, we are all doing this safely. As you will notice on the right-hand side of the page, coincide with the new normal, we have thoughtfully, not only increased safety protocols in our operations in many ways, we clearly understand that the new normal work environment could result in any manufacturing company deviating away from standardized operating processes. Accordingly, we have also elevated our focus on quality to be more proactive than ever as our operating challenges are required in the manufacturing environment. For example, as we adjusted shop floor operations to support social distancing protocols, we have ensured that all processes are revalidated to ensure that product and process characteristics meet our customers' requirements. Of course, this much translates over into new product launches as illustrated in the bottom right-hand corner of the page. We continue to see minimal delays in new product launches for future programs. Furthermore, to continue the steady stream of new product launches in the future, we continue to make investments in new product technology to support our customers' needs as they move from internal-combustion engine to electrified vehicles, which will drive growth across the businesses we serve. Now turning to slide six. I'd like to share some exciting news about another new electrification program we are working on. Our customers continue to recognize a strong value proposition for turnkey suppliers with full e-Powertrain capabilities. I will briefly remind the audience that what I mean by complete e-Powertrain capabilities. As you can see in the bottom left-hand side of the page, Dana, of course, has the e-Propulsion system capabilities, including the motor, inverter and driveline. Moving to the right, we also provide power electronics and battery system to complete the full e-Powertrain system.\\nBy having all of these capabilities in house, Dana, including our e-thermal competency is the only supplier with complete e-Powertrain supply capability, thus enabling us to partner closely with our customers to provide optimized and efficient solutions to meet their needs. Specific to the presentation page and announcing the exciting new business award, we were recently sourced the e-Powertrain by a major European commercial truck manufacturer for a new battery electric medium-duty truck that will be used for urban and regional product distribution. The vehicle production is slated to start next year. The 0-e y after several weeks of downtime.

The 0-e  right now as working capital becomes a headwind or excuse me, tailwind and starts to moves from a headwind to a tailwind in Q3, and we would expect to see strong sequential conversion on the incremental sales. And on a year-over-year basis, it certainly implies that we would still be lower than last year, but we still think those decrementals on a year-over-year basis are going to be in the mid-20s. So we think giving all those points, we're getting enough information to give people a sense of where we are without being too specific.\\nEmmanuel Rosner -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\\nGreat. And then secondly, I was hoping to learn a little bit more about your work and relationship with Hyliion. Can you just go over some of the motivation there? Do you think that natural gas solutions for truck will take off? Or is it sort of a good use of existing capacity that you have? Also curious sort of like how the relationship works and if you're willing to comment on how much did you invest or how much of the company do you own?\\nJames Kamsickas -- Chairman / Chief Executive Officer of Dana Incorporated\\nI'll take the first part, Emmanuel. Thanks for the question. Thanks for joining us today. The one key thing, I don't know that anybody has a crystal ball, but certainly, the OEMs have more of a crystal ball than I would or almost any supplier relative to fuel cell and all that other stuff. What I will tell you is you've often heard me use the word, what is Dana's strategic plan relative to electrification, future mobility, all that, and it's always been these set of words, which just is to be energy-source agnostic in terms of our drivelines and powertrains. And when we're talking about fuel cell vehicles, we're working on plenty of projects that you take our drivelines and they're essentially adaptable for those type of energy sources. So that's kind of that's probably the best answer I'd give you as you're trying to evaluate what's going on at Dana. Jonathan, I don't know if you have anything else?\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nSure. And just a reminder, what we discussed at our Investor Day last year, we've concentrated our investments on the medium-duty segment for fully electrified vehicles because we see more of the near-term opportunities. So the platform that Jim spoke about earlier that we've won in Europe is obviously fits with that. But on the heavy-vehicle side, particularly over-the-road long haul, we believe that hybrid applications are going to carry the day in the near term, as the infrastructure comes in place for fully electrified solutions in the longer run. So we're really excited about the opportunity to get the Spicer electrified e-Propulsion systems on the road in that category. From a financial standpoint, we made an equity-linked investment early last year. There will be a nice return on it, but we're not a major owner in the company. We will have a stake that will give us a nice return, but it's not going to be anything that's overly significant for Dana.\\nEmmanuel Rosner -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\\nOkay. And in terms of the way the relationship work, are you besides for the financial one, are you a Tier three supplier? Do you sell them the Spicer systems? And do you also do the integration? How does that actually work in practice?\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. The partnership has, aside from the financial aspect, has a couple of aspects. Number one, we will be their supplier of the e-Propulsion system. So that electric axle that or driveline that Jim referred to, that had the motor, the inverter and the torque transfer via the gears is going to be the Dana system. That will be combined with their e-Power system, there hybrid controller, the battery pack and all the auxiliaries to provide the full hybrid electric powertrain. The second aspect of the relationship is from a manufacturing standpoint. We have offered our manufacturing expertise to help get the full systems put together, manufactured and delivered to customers. So t  right now as working capital becomes a headwind or excuse me, tailwind and starts to moves from a headwind to a tailwind in Q3, and we would expect to see strong sequential conversion on the incremental sales. And on a year-over-year basis, it certainly implies that we would still be lower than last year, but we still think those decrementals on a year-over-year basis are going to be in the mid-20s.

And in terms of the way the relationship work, are you besides for the financial one, are you a Tier three supplier? Do you sell them the Spicer systems? And do you also do the integration? How does that actually work in practice?\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. The partnership has, aside from the financial aspect, has a couple of aspects. Number one, we will be their supplier of the e-Propulsion system. So that electric axle that or driveline that Jim referred to, that had the motor, the inverter and the torque transfer via the gears is going to be the Dana system. That will be combined with their e-Power system, there hybrid controller, the battery pack and all the auxiliaries to provide the full hybrid electric powertrain. The second aspect of the relationship is from a manufacturing standpoint. We have offered our manufacturing expertise to help get the full systems put together, manufactured and delivered to customers. So t  there doing complete solutions, and so they wanted a complete solution? And just more broadly on the competitive landscape. It sounds like you're the only one with a complete solution, is that correct? And to what extent are your customers in the heavier applications looking to in-source on electrification?\\nJames Kamsickas -- Chairman / Chief Executive Officer of Dana Incorporated\\nYes, that's a big question. And I would tell you there's one this is Jim. No one shoe fits all, with each customer. I would tell you kind of emphasizing the complete system capability speaking in an example terms, as I'm pretty sure you're aware, we've been in the thermal management business for 100 years. And when you think about a full e-Propulsion system and the impact on cooling batteries, electronics, all of the other moving parts associated with it, now couple that with all of our capabilities, that's kind of how you get to the full system differentiation as one differentiator. But coming back to your question more specifically on how do the decisions get made, one, I'm not in the boardrooms at the OEM specifically to know how they're thinking about things. But I will tell you this, is that it all starts at the engineering level, engineering of the products.\\nAnd your engineering teams have to have with the OEMS, they have to have great confidence that they're going to bet the bet their business on somebody that can actually make sure that the whole system is going to integrate. When it's on the road, you're going to be able to react to it. You're going to be able to diagnose it, you're going to be able to supply parts to it, you're going to have to everything. And if everything is shopped out and everything is kind of just kind of trying to cobble things together from the outside looking in, I don't know that, that gives customers a great deal of confidence that when their vehicle, they're going to get down the road that they're not going to get a brand pop in the face for it. So we believe that, that's a competitive advantage that it's all in-house. And Joel engineer talks to Suzi engineer talks to Tony engineer, and they find a way to get it done. And we think we find that many of our customers see it the same way. So it's a long-winded answer to your question, but that's about the best I can give you.\\nDan Levy -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\\nOkay. That's helpful. If I could just squeeze in one more. Just if you could, housekeeping, if you could provide some parameters on what you expect in working capital in the second half?\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. Similar with what we communicated with the breakeven analysis that we shared at the end of the first quarter, we were expecting this significant of a sales decline for working capital to be a substantial source of cash. It's really going to start to happen in the third quarter. So inventories came down late in the second quarter. That's going to convert to cash in the third quarter. So we would expect to have a significant generation of cash from working capital in the second half of the year and also on a full year basis.\\nDan Levy -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\\nOkay, great, thank you very much.\\nOperator\\nI have a Noah. Your line is open. If you're on mute please unmute your line.\\nJoseph Beninati -- Oppenheimer -- Analyst\\nIt's Joe on for Noah. Thanks for taking our questions this morning.. Just circling back on the decrementals. Are you expecting similar decrementals in 3Q as you saw in 2Q? And if so, that would imply 3Q EBITDA potentially more than $100 million. And I guess the decrementals raw material were sequentially. Can you just point to any puts and takes regarding that?\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nNo, I think as far as the decrementals are concerned, we shared the breakeven scenario at the end of last quarter. It implied full year decrementals in the mid-20s. So I think we expect to remain pretty close to that range on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter. So I think that's a pretty reason ickly to the relative to electrification, new energy preparedness, as all of us would agree, who knows exactly where things are going to stop and end up and who does what and all that stuff, infrastructure, readiness, etc, etc? But from our standpoint, we know what our strengths are, and our strengths are to have great people, people finding a better way, miles on the road. How long the people or kilometers on the road for that matter, how long the people actually been doing this? What is their experience? What are their lessons learned? All these learnings, all of these capabilities roll over into, again, who knows what's going to be next in new energy, but we know we're going to have markets and area work platforms or buses or underground mining or medium-duty last mile or whatever it is. All of it's shared, all of it's tied, and it's how our business model is coming together. So thanks, everybody, for your time and attention.

So I think that's a pretty reason  right now as working capital becomes a headwind or excuse me, tailwind and starts to moves from a headwind to a tailwind in Q3, and we would expect to see strong sequential conversion on the incremental sales. And on a year-over-year basis, it certainly implies that we would still be lower than last year, but we still think those decrementals on a year-over-year basis are going to be in the mid-20s. So we think giving all those points, we're getting enough information to give people a sense of where we are without being too specific.\\nEmmanuel Rosner -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\\nGreat. And then secondly, I was hoping to learn a little bit more about your work and relationship with Hyliion. Can you just go over some of the motivation there? Do you think that natural gas solutions for truck will take off? Or is it sort of a good use of existing capacity that you have? Also curious sort of like how the relationship works and if you're willing to comment on how much did you invest or how much of the company do you own?\\nJames Kamsickas -- Chairman / Chief Executive Officer of Dana Incorporated\\nI'll take the first part, Emmanuel. Thanks for the question. Thanks for joining us today. The one key thing, I don't know that anybody has a crystal ball, but certainly, the OEMs have more of a crystal ball than I would or almost any supplier relative to fuel cell and all that other stuff. What I will tell you is you've often heard me use the word, what is Dana's strategic plan relative to electrification, future mobility, all that, and it's always been these set of words, which just is to be energy-source agnostic in terms of our drivelines and powertrains. And when we're talking about fuel cell vehicles, we're working on plenty of projects that you take our drivelines and they're essentially adaptable for those type of energy sources. So that's kind of that's probably the best answer I'd give you as you're trying to evaluate what's going on at Dana. Jonathan, I don't know if you have anything else?\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nSure. And just a reminder, what we discussed at our Investor Day last year, we've concentrated our investments on the medium-duty segment for fully electrified vehicles because we see more of the near-term opportunities. So the platform that Jim spoke about earlier that we've won in Europe is obviously fits with that. But on the heavy-vehicle side, particularly over-the-road long haul, we believe that hybrid applications are going to carry the day in the near term, as the infrastructure comes in place for fully electrified solutions in the longer run. So we're really excited about the opportunity to get the Spicer electrified e-Propulsion systems on the road in that category. From a financial standpoint, we made an equity-linked investment early last year. There will be a nice return on it, but we're not a major owner in the company. We will have a stake that will give us a nice return, but it's not going to be anything that's overly significant for Dana.\\nEmmanuel Rosner -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\\nOkay. And in terms of the way the relationship work, are you besides for the financial one, are you a Tier three supplier? Do you sell them the Spicer systems? And do you also do the integration? How does that actually work in practice?\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. The partnership has, aside from the financial aspect, has a couple of aspects. Number one, we will be their supplier of the e-Propulsion system. So that electric axle that or driveline that Jim referred to, that had the motor, the inverter and the torque transfer via the gears is going to be the Dana system. That will be combined with their e-Power system, there hybrid controller, the battery pack and all the auxiliaries to provide the full hybrid electric powertrain. The second aspect of the relationship is from a manufacturing standpoint. We have offered our manufacturing expertise to help get the full systems put together, manufactured and delivered to customers. So t able assumption.\\nJoseph Beninati -- Oppenheimer -- Analyst\\nGot it. And then I guess, also, in the past quarter, we've seen quite a bit of attention on policy development and access to capital for hybrid fuel cell powertrains, particularly in commercial vehicles. So you guys have already supplied fuel cell stacks. But wondering if you see the opportunity or need going forward to expand your offerings in this area, similar to how you've done with EVs? And if so, where you'd like to focus your investments?\\nJames Kamsickas -- Chairman / Chief Executive Officer of Dana Incorporated\\nThanks for the question, Joe. I appreciate it very much. You never say never. You're right. Our experience in fuel cell is goes back decades as well. It certainly helps us be in the game relative to the full driveline solution or integration solution as we're working on many projects in that regard and especially in the commercial vehicle segment. To do more as it relates to the actual stack, that's not our intention. Right now, it's to support our customers like we have for years. But we'll see how that market continues to unfold. As you know, it's a little bit further out there, and a lot of folks are thinking about it, working on it. But we keep our ear to the ground and keep our technology road maps in place to be flexible.\\nJoseph Beninati -- Oppenheimer -- Analyst\\nSure. If I could just squeeze one more in, circling back on the product launches. You've announced a number of these wins for the fully integrated powertrain supply. Are those launches generally tracking time line-wise similar to your expectations?\\nAnd then second, can you talk a little bit about how you're managing the supply chain and make first-buy decisions for EV components, given the limited scale in the industry?\\nJames Kamsickas -- Chairman / Chief Executive Officer of Dana Incorporated\\nThanks again for the question. I would say, first of all, yes, they're tracking. As I said in previous calls, the way I would look at it, I think most people are there's a bit of a bubble for everybody in the world, whatever you want to pick, six, eight weeks. You could argue that launches are delayed a little bit by that amount, but that's not substantial anyway. Back to your supply chain piece of it, you're right. That's a good observation that you don't have as much history on that, but I don't think by accident that our acquisition and roll-up of various electrified assets out there, people that have been doing some form of electric vehicles and components for well over decades, such as obviously, TM4, Ashwoods. The list goes on, SME, etc, and even today's announcement on Rational Motion, the best of the best supply base they've worked with. We're working with them, and we're working off of that to build up the most sophisticated and robust supply chain we can.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from the line of James Picariello with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\\nJames Picariello -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst\\nHey, good morning guys.\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nGood morning.\\nJames Picariello -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst\\nIf we compare your cost structure next year to 2019 as a base, excluding any impact from acquisitions, is there a structural cost savings number we should be considering for 2021? Or would that maybe just be captured in a mid-20% incremental margin contribution?\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. At this point, we're not giving a specific number, but we would indicate that of structural cost actions taken in the second quarter. Some of them will be permanent. It won't be insignificant. So we do think it's going to be something that's going to help the margins be higher on the upswing or the incrementals to be higher than they would have been prior to that. So certainly, there's a combination. There are a number of temporary actions that we referred to, but there are some permanent ones as well there. And as we get toward the end of the year and start providing an ou ickly to the relative to electrification, new energy preparedness, as all of us would agree, who knows exactly where things are going to stop and end up and who does what and all that stuff, infrastructure, readiness, etc, etc? But from our standpoint, we know what our strengths are, and our strengths are to have great people, people finding a better way, miles on the road. How long the people or kilometers on the road for that matter, how long the people actually been doing this? What is their experience? What are their lessons learned? All these learnings, all of these capabilities roll over into, again, who knows what's going to be next in new energy, but we know we're going to have markets and area work platforms or buses or underground mining or medium-duty last mile or whatever it is.

There's been a lot of buzz about Hyliion, a company we first told you about earlier last year. We are excited about the opportunity or market opportunity through our strategic partnership and equity-linked investment with Hyliion. Earlier this year, Hyliion delivered the first of three hybrid Class eight vehicles to a leading transportation services provider with the remaining vehicles slated to be delivered later this year. Through this partnership, Dana is their source for the e-Propulsion system, including traditional driveline components as well as fully integrated e-Axles, which include motors, inverters, controls, gear boxes as well as thermal management technologies. The Hyliion system converts a traditional 6 times2 into hybrid by adding Dana's e-Propulsion system. The system allows for easy installation and simple servicing. It's an engine-type agnostic and can be installed on any Class eight vehicle from any manufacturer. This is another example of how we are committed to helping our customers navigate the electrification journey with industry-leading technologies and programs. Thanks to our strategic partners such as this one, we have a unique opportunity to implement high-value proposition, long-haul solutions that revolutionize power commands and help our customers to meet their sustainability goals.\\nPlease turn with me to slide nine to hear about more exciting and highly anticipated vehicle debuts in years. As I'm sure you're aware, Ford revealed or unveiled its 2021 Built Wild, two-door and four-door, mono Broncos and the new Bronco Sport a few weeks ago. You may not be aware of this, but Dana's involvement with the Bronco program dates back to its initial launch in 1966, and we are excited once again to be collaborating with Ford to offer a robust suite of advanced driveline, sealing and thermal management technologies for this exciting new vehicle family. Our featured technologies in the Ford Bronco include the Dana 44 AdvanTEK solid rear axle and the Dana AdvanTEK independent front axle. From those who want to want extreme performance, there is an optional upgrade to the Dana 44 AdvanTEK independent front axle. All of these axles are available in the Spicer, pro forma track electric locking differentials. The Bronco also uses a Spicer rear drive shaft with Dana-designed constant velocity joints and our industry-leading thermal management and sealing technologies. We first announced this program win back in 2017. In fact, Ford has stated that they selected Dana's axles even before they decided the frame of the vehicle, and we are looking forward to seeing the Bronco out on the trail. We're not able to announce at the time was Dana's driveline system would be featured on the all-new Ford Bronco sport.\\nThis new vehicle will be equipped with Dana Spicer AdvanTEK ultra rear axle and Spicer SmartConnect disconnecting 4 times4 system. Dana and Ford have a long history together, and we're proud to once again be partnering on these exciting models, which are part of one of the fastest-growing vehicle segments in the United States. In fact, in 2019, sales of the SUVs in United States were nearly 50%. As our customers increase their offerings in this segment, we are looking to leverage driveline solutions to deliver the best on-road experience as well as the high-performance pickups and SUVs used for off roading as well. Dana supported this growing segment and their desire to enhance, customize and personalize their vehicles with aftermarket solu European-based customers as well as further strengthen our global development of software and controls for complete electric vehicle integration.

Please go ahead.\\nRyan Brinkman -- JPMorgan -- Analyst\\nHi, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask on capital allocation. I think you'd already planned to march toward 1 times leverage or investment-grade credit metrics even prior to the crisis. Of course, now it would take longer. You'd not levered to repurchase shares, thankfully in recent years like some other suppliers. And I see you're still doing bolt-ons. But just maybe broadly, does the experience with coronavirus changed at all how you think about capital allocation or leverage going forward?\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nNo, I don't think so. I think as you noted, it's going to take us a bit longer to get there, given this environment. So as we pre crisis, we had anticipated generating substantial cash flow in the business and intended to use that to delever. That remains our priority, but it's going to take a bit longer. So as we see the second half of this year play out, hopefully, things stabilize and market conditions improve in 2021, you would be seeing us look to generate more meaningful cash flow and use that to continue to delever the balance sheet. And as you noted, the cost of the Rational Motion acquisition is very small. So we'll continue to make smart plays to position ourselves to deliver great electrified products to our customers in the coming years, but you're going to see most of it go toward continuing to get toward that target of the one turn net leverage.\\nRyan Brinkman -- JPMorgan -- Analyst\\nOkay. And then just obviously, there's been a tremendous amount of enthusiasm in the public markets recently with regard to Tesla, Nikola, hopefully, for you in relation to Hyliion soon. Just curious the extent to which you think that coronavirus may delay or accelerate the transition toward sustainable transportation, just knowing what that means for you guys potentially from a content per vehicle perspective on the commercial side.\\nJames Kamsickas -- Chairman / Chief Executive Officer of Dana Incorporated\\nI can only go based on the inputs I have, of course, in answering the question. It doesn't mean I have a crystal ball for everybody, all the OEMs' capital allocation plans and everything else. But at least from my chair, our chairs, really, it's nothing's changed. Every program we're working on, everyone we're quoting, everything we're hearing or seeing is still steady as you go. That's a direct answer to a question much better than I did earlier. So I hope that answers.\\nRyan Brinkman -- JPMorgan -- Analyst\\nVery good, thank you.\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nSure.

So can you just tell us what you are seeing in your conversations with customers? Because there's a little bit of at odds with some of the other commentary out there.\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nSure. I think in the prepared remarks, what we indicated was we are seeing the orders, the same information that the orders are getting a bit better. We're not necessarily seeing that as a meaningful impact to our production schedules compared to what we were anticipating, but certainly, some improvement will take.

I think we're probably just remaining a bit cautious. We anticipated this year on Class eight was going to be a s  Dana manufacturing and technical facilities was challenging enough, but then you factor in the execution required to ensure supply chain continuity from our Tier one integrated global supply chain across nearly 50 countries. I cannot possibly thank the Dana team and our supply partners enough for their amazing and continued efforts in helping us safely bring our operations back online around the world. They have committed countless hours establishing and sharing best practices and especially from the initial high-impact COVID areas, such as China and Italy, and collaborating to ensure that everyone stayed safe as we brought high-volume manufacturing back online quickly and efficiently.\\nLooking to the center of the page, approximately six weeks ago, we started to ramp up operations in line with our customer start-up schedules, most aggressively in the light vehicle North America market and global agricultural markets. As a reminder, this was all occurring while Dana never stopped operation in what was characterized as essential businesses such as aftermarket and industrial products, thus making our operational challenge, let's say, that much more interesting. Specific to the light vehicle North America markets, throughout May, there was uncertainty as to how fast the customers would be able to restart and when the supply operations would be permitted to resume, especially in Mexico. In the end, the May ramp-up was somewhat slower than expected, but ultimately, all operations came back up at a very good cadence. As we moved into June, we experienced accelerating customer demand as they looked to replenish low dealer inventories. In addition, many of our customers have indicated that they will have limited or no summer shutdowns. In our European and South African operations, our light vehicle customers started a little slower, but they, too, have largely returned, not quite to pre-COVID volumes but to reasonable volume levels. Pivoting to our commercial vehicle customers in North America, they, too, restarted in May after several weeks of downtime. Obviously, volumes are down from the record highs of the previous years, but there is resiliency there more than some would have predicted. The global off-highway markets have restarted because we restarted across the board with varying run rates depending on the region and the end markets. We continue to see stronger demand in agriculture and weaker demand in construction.\\nAnd as I stated earlier, our aftermarket business continues to operate uninterrupted. As you can imagine, with different end markets ramping up production at different rates, cohesively and consistently executing a very robust global operational and supply chain management system is essential to success. The Dana operational purchasing and supply chain management team did a remarkable job navigating through the ebbs and flows of the dramatic customer requirement changes. And of course, this was not only on a country-by-country basis as the pandemic altered manufacturing around the world, but often on a state-by-state or providence-by-providence basis. Drawing your attention to the center of the page, customer engagement may have slowed for a brief period of time. But today, we are back, albeit in its new normal of digital communications where we left off pre-COVID. Customer satisfaction starts with having great people who have a tremendous passion for creating value for our customers. At Dana, customer satisfaction is in our DNA, and the team is executing product design reviews, product validation testing, launch readiness reviews and all other facets of the business.\\nMost importantly, we are all doing this safely. As you will notice on the right-hand side of the page, coincide with the new normal, we have thoughtfully, not only increased safety protocols in our operations in many ways, we clearly understand that the new normal work environment could result in any manufacturing company deviating away from standardized operating processes. Accordingly, we have also elevated our focus on quality to be more proa tlook for next year, we'll provide some more color on that.\\nJames Picariello -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst\\nOkay. Got it. And as we think about your backlog, new business backlog contribution for the back half and maybe within the context of the full year, right, the original guide of $350 million, just wondering if there's any order of magnitude or color you could provide on your thoughts. It does seem as though you're seeing minimal launch delays for new programs. Just any color.\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nYes, I think that's right. The only color we'd give there is what we shared before, which is the reduction of the backlog is going to be pretty much in line with what we're seeing in our overall change in sales. So certainly, the dollar amount is going to be lower by a comparable amount. As Jim mentioned, the program shifts are relatively insignificant at this point, and we still expect to have a pretty similar cadence of launches going into next year that we would have expected earlier this year.\\nJames Picariello -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst\\nHave you worked with Rational Motion in the past? And today from a vehicle mix or customer channel standpoint, who have they been working with?\\nJames Kamsickas -- Chairman / Chief Executive Officer of Dana Incorporated\\nGood question, by the way. The first part of the question, I'd give you a kind of a yes, but answer to it. Yes, via our TM4 team that we acquired whatever it was 1.5 years ago or so, they can literally finish each other's sentences. They were essentially the outlet for TM4 in Europe for all the activities, anywhere from quoting to design to whatever the case may be. And their background and back to your engineering question, if that's what we call it in products background, actually, they started and spent a large portion of their early days in their business tied into Formula E racing, in particular with Toyota, and then into a multiple of other products. And you can see some of those hosted pictures recently. They've worked on the coordination and integration of various electrified components. So a really good background and history.\\nJames Picariello -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst\\nOkay. Sure.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\\nRod Lache -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\nGood morning, everybody. A lot of focus, obviously, on the Bronco, and I wasn't aware of your position on the Bronco Sport. I was hoping you might just be able to speak to us a little bit more broadly about the backlog of new business that you're looking at in light vehicle as you look out to 2021. And then also on the new business front, just given this intensity of activity that we're hearing about in EV programs, have you updated your view on the trajectory that you see for EV growth for you? How big this could be at a certain point in time?\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nSure. Just to the backlog, specifically on the Bronco, Rod, all three of the vehicle variants and the technology that Jim talked about just a few moments ago, have been contemplated in our backlog. So that's been a part of our calculation the entire time. We really think that the trends in consumers shifting from cars or sedans to full-size SUV and many of them that have off-road capability is really moving in the right direction. So we're really excited about the launch of that product. On the electrified side, as we highlighted earlier this year, there's a more significant portion of our backlog that's now in electrified vehicles. Certainly the one that we announced earlier on the call will be accretive to that. It was not in the backlog when we started this year, and we continue to see more opportunity to grow our backlog on the electrified products, particularly in the heavy vehicle market. So a lot of activity there, as Jim mentioned, in last-mile or urban delivery of medium-duty vehicles. But then also, we're really excited about the potential for the throu  Dana manufacturing and technical facilities was challenging enough, but then you factor in the execution required to ensure supply chain continuity from our Tier one integrated global supply chain across nearly 50 countries.

And now I'd like to turn the call over to Jonathan for a look at our financial results.\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nThank you, Jim. Good morning to all of you listening in. I'd like to begin with an update on the progress we made on our near-term financial priorities, which I outlined on last quarter's call. So please turn with me to Page 11. Starting on the left side of the slide, our first priority, as we face the market uncertainty was to conserve cash as production schedules and sales began to fall off due to the global pandemic. We focused on four key actions to achieve this objective. First, we aggressively managed our supply chain by reducing material orders and lowered our inventory by more than $75 million in the first half of the year. Second, we flexed our conversion costs by utilizing temporary layoffs of direct and indirect hourly associates, temporarily reducing compensation for salary associates and aggressively lowering our overhead spending across all nonlabor categories. The combination of these actions led to decremental margins of less than 25% on an organic sales decline of more than 50%, which I'll discuss a bit more in a few moments. Third, we continued to make prudent decisions on where to invest capital. In the second quarter, we reduced our capital spending by more than 35% compared to last year while continuing to serve our customers on current and new programs. Finally, our common stock dividend remained temporarily suspended as a means to further preserve cash during this unprecedented time.\\nOur second priority, as shown on the right of the page, was to maximize our liquidity. We took several actions in the second quarter to that end. We issued $500 million in new senior unsecured notes. Proceeds from this issuance added to our cash balance, which at the end of June was more than $700 million, an increase of over $50 million compared to the end of March. We used a portion of the proceeds to repay the $300 million revolver balance from the draw we made in March. We now have access to the entire $1 billion of ready capital on the facility and terminated the $500 million undrawn bridge facility that was put into place at the beginning of the pandemic out of an abundance of caution to guarantee our access to additional liquidity. We've maintained the amended terms of our senior credit facility to allow additional headroom under our sole maintenance covenant. As a reminder, we do not have any significant debt maturities for the next few years. In total, we had $1.7 billion of liquidity at the end of the second quarter, which is typically the seasonal working capital peak in our business. Please turn with me now to slide 12 for an overview of our second quarter results compared with the same period last year. Second quarter sales were $1.1 billion, a decrease of $1.2 billion compared to the same period last year, driven by lower demand resulting from production shutdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was nearly breakeven at a loss of just $5 million, $291 million lower than the same period last year. Net income was a loss of $174 million, $106 million lower than the second quarter of 2019.\\nEarnings were reduced due to higher income tax expense resulting from the establishing $56 million in valuation allowances in foreign jurisdictions. The second quarter of 2019 was reduced by $258 million in onetime pension settlement charges related to the transfer of future pension liabilities from the U.S. pension plan to third-party insurers. Partially offsetting this onetime charge was a net tax benefit of $87 million in the second quarter of last year, driven by the pension termination and foreign tax credits. Excluding these onetime tax and pension charges, the second quarter net loss was $118 million in 2020 compared with net income of $103 million in 2019, reflecting the lower operating earning hat's a part of the relationship as well, too.\\nEmmanuel Rosner -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\\nGreat, thank you.\\nOperator\\nYour next question is from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.

You could argue that launches are delayed a little bit by that amount, but that's not substantial anyway. Back to your supply chain piece of it, you're right. That's a good observation that you don't have as much history on that, but I don't think by accident that our acquisition and roll-up of various electrified assets out there, people that have been doing some form of electric vehicles and components for well over decades, such as obviously, TM4, Ashwoods. The list goes on, SME, etc, and even today's announcement on Rational Motion, the best of the best supply base they've worked with. We're working with them, and we're working off of that to build up the most sophisticated and robust supply chain we can.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from the line of James Picariello with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\\nJames Picariello -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst\\nHey, good morning guys.\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nGood morning.\\nJames Picariello -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst\\nIf we compare your cost structure next year to 2019 as a base, excluding any impact from acquisitions, is there a structural cost savings number we should be considering for 2021? Or would that maybe just be captured in a mid-20% incremental margin contribution?\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. At this point, we're not giving a specific number, but we would indicate that of structural cost actions taken in the second quarter. Some of them will be permanent. It won't be insignificant. So we do think it's going to be something that's going to help the margins be higher on the upswing or the incrementals to be higher than they would have been prior to that. So certainly, there's a combination. There are a number of temporary actions that we referred to, but there are some permanent ones as well there. And as we get toward the end of the year and start providing an outlook for next year, we'll provide some more color on that.\\nJames Picariello -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst\\nOkay. Got it. And as we think about your backlog, new business backlog contribution for the back half and maybe within the context of the full year, right, the original guide of $350 million, just wondering if there's any order of magnitude or color you could provide on your thoughts. It does seem as though you're seeing minimal launch delays for new programs. Just any color.\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nYes, I think that's right. The only color we'd give there is what we shared before, which is the reduction of the backlog is going to be pretty much in line with what we're seeing in our overall change in sales. So certainly, the dollar amount is going to be lower by a comparable amount. As Jim mentioned, the program shifts are relatively insignificant at this point, and we still expect to have a pretty similar cadence of launches going into next year that we would have expected earlier this year.\\nJames Picariello -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst\\nHave you worked with Rational Motion in the past? And today from a vehicle mix or customer channel standpoint, who have they been working with?\\nJames Kamsickas -- Chairman / Chief Executive Officer of Dana Incorporated\\nGood question, by the way. The first part of the question, I'd give you a kind of a yes, but answer to it. Yes, via our TM4 team that we acquired whatever it was 1.5 years ago or so, they can literally finish each other's sentences. They were essentially the outlet for TM4 in Europe for all the activities, anywhere from quoting to design to whatever the case may be. And their background and back to your engineering question, if that's what we call it in products background, actually, they started and spent a large portion of their early days in their business tied into Formula E racing, in particular with Toyota, and then into a multiple of other products. And you can see some of those hosted pict le for everybody in the world, whatever you want to pick, six, eight weeks. You could argue that launches are delayed a little bit by that amount, but that's not substantial anyway. Back to your supply chain piece of it, you're right. That's a good observation that you don't have as much history on that, but I don't think by accident that our acquisition and roll-up of various electrified assets out there, people that have been doing some form of electric vehicles and components for well over decades, such as obviously, TM4, Ashwoods.

And you can see some of those hosted pictures recently. They've worked on the coordination and integration of various electrified components. So a really good background and history.\\nJames Picariello -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst\\nOkay. Sure.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\\nRod Lache -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\nGood morning, everybody. A lot of focus, obviously, on the Bronco, and I wasn't aware of your position on the Bronco Sport. I was hoping you might just be able to speak to us a little bit more broadly about the backlog of new business that you're looking at in light vehicle as you look out to 2021. And then also on the new business front, just given this intensity of activity that we're hearing about in EV programs, have you updated your view on the trajectory that you see for EV growth for you? How big this could be at a certain point in time?\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nSure. Just to the backlog, specifically on the Bronco, Rod, all three of the vehicle variants and the technology that Jim talked about just a few moments ago, have been contemplated in our backlog. So that's been a part of our calculation the entire time. We really think that the trends in consumers shifting from cars or sedans to full-size SUV and many of them that have off-road capability is really moving in the right direction. So we're really excited about the launch of that product. On the electrified side, as we highlighted earlier this year, there's a more significant portion of our backlog that's now in electrified vehicles. Certainly the one that we announced earlier on the call will be accretive to that. It was not in the backlog when we started this year, and we continue to see more opportunity to grow our backlog on the electrified products, particularly in the heavy vehicle market. So a lot of activity there, as Jim mentioned, in last-mile or urban delivery of medium-duty vehicles. But then also, we're really excited about the potential for the throu tlook for next year, we'll provide some more color on that.\\nJames Picariello -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst\\nOkay. Got it. And as we think about your backlog, new business backlog contribution for the back half and maybe within the context of the full year, right, the original guide of $350 million, just wondering if there's any order of magnitude or color you could provide on your thoughts.

So a lot of activity there, as Jim mentioned, in last-mile or urban delivery of medium-duty vehicles. But then also, we're really excited about the potential for the throu ght or medium duty, both of those continues to be soft.\\nAnd if anything, Class 8, it's probably a little bit softer than we would have expected just a couple of months ago. So that's what that arrow is intending to represent. And then off-highway, on balance, across all three segments is probably pretty consistent with what we thought. As we said, ag continued to do reasonably well. But really, construction and mining have been quite soft around the world with the exception of in China where that came back quite strong. So on balance, that's what we were trying to indicate as compared to what we expected, and that all gets to the sense that we think we're going to be 50% better than 50% from a sequential standpoint in Q3 compared to where we were last quarter.\\nRod Lache -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\nOkay, all right, thank you.\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nSure.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.\\nEmmanuel Rosner -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\\nHi, good morning everybody.\\nJames Kamsickas -- Chairman / Chief Executive Officer of Dana Incorporated\\nGood morning.\\nEmmanuel Rosner -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\\nYour third quarter outlook for positive adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow, it seems like a pretty low bar. If your revenue is going to grow more than 50% and decrementals are still in the mid-20s, you can probably do more than, I guess, more than $100 million. So any other factors that we're not thinking about in terms of negative offset? Or is it just are you trying to just stay a little more vague?\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. It's more of the latter, Emmanuel. We were just indicating that, obviously, conditions are improving significantly on the top line, and they will. So we weren't saying we're going to be just above breakeven on both. We're going to generate a significant amount of cash flow in the third quarter based on what we see right now as working capital becomes a headwind or excuse me, tailwind and starts to moves from a headwind to a tailwind in Q3, and we would expect to see strong sequential conversion on the incremental sales. And on a year-over-year basis, it certainly implies that we would still be lower than last year, but we still think those decrementals on a year-over-year basis are going to be in the mid-20s. So we think giving all those points, we're getting enough information to give people a sense of where we are without being too specific.\\nEmmanuel Rosner -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\\nGreat. And then secondly, I was hoping to learn a little bit more about your work and relationship with Hyliion. Can you just go over some of the motivation there? Do you think that natural gas solutions for truck will take off? Or is it sort of a good use of existing capacity that you have? Also curious sort of like how the relationship works and if you're willing to comment on how much did you invest or how much of the company do you own?\\nJames Kamsickas -- Chairman / Chief Executive Officer of Dana Incorporated\\nI'll take the first part, Emmanuel. Thanks for the question. Thanks for joining us today. The one key thing, I don't know that anybody has a crystal ball, but certainly, the OEMs have more of a crystal ball than I would or almost any supplier relative to fuel cell and all that other stuff. What I will tell you is you've often heard me use the word, what is Dana's strategic plan relative to electrification, future mobility, all that, and it's always been these set of words, which just is to be energy-source agnostic in terms of our drivelines and powertrains. And when we're talking about fuel cell vehicles, we're working on plenty of projects that you take our drivelines and they're essentially adaptable for those type of energy sources. So that's kind of that's probably the best answer I'd give you as you're trying to evaluate what's going on at Dana. Jonathan, I don't know if you have anything else?\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive oft year coming into it, and obviously, the current dynamics have only exacerbated that. So I think just generally, we're a bit more cautious. The other thing is, as a reminder, the medium-duty segment for us in commercial vehicle is important, and that has been quite a bit softer than we would have started thought at the beginning of the year, and the recovery there is going a bit slower. So I would say it's a combination of our views on heavy- and medium-duty vehicles in that segment that put us in a place where we're a bit cautious on the commercial vehicle segment.\\nJoseph Spak -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\\nOkay. And Jim, thanks for the good explanation about Rational Motion. I guess I'm just still trying to wrap my head around a little bit more. Is this really more for now, at least of the way we should think about it as sort of like in engineering acquihire, so you get better competency internally about how these systems work. And then eventually, you can sort of help your customers. Or did I misinterpret that?\\nJames Kamsickas -- Chairman / Chief Executive Officer of Dana Incorporated\\nYes. I think you're absolutely all over it, very usual. It is. I've said it since the very beginning, people thought you're about acquisitions and electrification and top line and OK, sure. Yes. All right. Not really, though. I mean it's really more about being ahead of the curve, getting the best people with the best talent, so the learning structure organization, you're learning structure organization, not sitting in your headquarters, but sitting at your distributed technology centers around the world and being prepared for that. Because, ultimately, one thing about vehicles and any industrial systems, if you want to call it, the winner comes back to the efficiencies between the moving parts and the systems and controls, and all those learnings and ability to go through this is what's really important from future efficiencies and best systems that are out there. So to answer your question, yes.\\nJoseph Spak -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\\nOkay. And then last one is just on Hyliion. So you're providing the e-Axle Spicer product. Is there a major difference between what you would provide and what you're doing for them, which is effectively a retrofit hybrid solution versus what you would provide to like a brand-new sort of OE, whether either it's BEV or fuel cell, the axle solution? Or is it basically the same product?\\nJames Kamsickas -- Chairman / Chief Executive Officer of Dana Incorporated\\nNo, it's a good point. It's basically the same product. So the three-in-one system with the motor, the inverter and the gears is essentially comparable to what you'd see on a fully electrified vehicle. Most of the difference in the powertrain would be north of that. So into the size of the battery pack, the controls, all of that would be different in the e-Power system. So the e-Propulsion system is very comparable.\\nJoseph Spak -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\\nOkay, thank you very much.\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nSure. Thanks, Joe.\\nOperator\\nYour next question is from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Please go ahead.\\nBrian Johnson -- Barclays -- Analyst\\nYes. Just the final housekeeping talk question. So between when you gave your guidance for adjusted FCF breakeven to use when you updated it at a June conference, was it really the swing in inventory or other parts of working capital that was the big difference in your thinking?\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. Yes, Brian, just to be specific. At the end of the first quarter, we said that adjusted EBITDA would be about breakeven, but we did say that we would be a use of cash in the quarter. We specified that a bit more midway through the quarter to make sure it was clear that people knew that it would be slightly more than what we saw in Q1. And you're right, the primary driver is we didn't have a crystal ball to when production was going to go down and come back up, so we tried to clarify that the  oft year coming into it, and obviously, the current dynamics have only exacerbated that. So I think just generally, we're a bit more cautious. The other thing is, as a reminder, the medium-duty segment for us in commercial vehicle is important, and that has been quite a bit softer than we would have started thought at the beginning of the year, and the recovery there is going a bit slower.

And you're right, the primary driver is we didn't have a crystal ball to when production was going to go down and come back up, so we tried to clarify that the  ctive than ever as our operating challenges are required in the manufacturing environment. For example, as we adjusted shop floor operations to support social distancing protocols, we have ensured that all processes are revalidated to ensure that product and process characteristics meet our customers' requirements. Of course, this much translates over into new product launches as illustrated in the bottom right-hand corner of the page. We continue to see minimal delays in new product launches for future programs. Furthermore, to continue the steady stream of new product launches in the future, we continue to make investments in new product technology to support our customers' needs as they move from internal-combustion engine to electrified vehicles, which will drive growth across the businesses we serve. Now turning to slide six. I'd like to share some exciting news about another new electrification program we are working on. Our customers continue to recognize a strong value proposition for turnkey suppliers with full e-Powertrain capabilities. I will briefly remind the audience that what I mean by complete e-Powertrain capabilities. As you can see in the bottom left-hand side of the page, Dana, of course, has the e-Propulsion system capabilities, including the motor, inverter and driveline. Moving to the right, we also provide power electronics and battery system to complete the full e-Powertrain system.\\nBy having all of these capabilities in house, Dana, including our e-thermal competency is the only supplier with complete e-Powertrain supply capability, thus enabling us to partner closely with our customers to provide optimized and efficient solutions to meet their needs. Specific to the presentation page and announcing the exciting new business award, we were recently sourced the e-Powertrain by a major European commercial truck manufacturer for a new battery electric medium-duty truck that will be used for urban and regional product distribution. The vehicle production is slated to start next year. The 0-emissions electric truck will be equipped with the Dana content and upfitted to the chassis. We'll supply the e-Powertrain system, which generates and stores and manages the energy for the vehicle, consisting of the battery packs and the electrified auxiliary systems. The vehicle will also utilize the Dana CO300 inverter as well as what we describe as a SUMO HD motor coupled to a Dana driveshaft. Dana-developed software and controls will run the diagnostics and telemetry of the complete system. As the global demand for fuel-efficient, low-emission vehicles continue to expand, our ability to leverage our long-standing leadership in truck driveline capabilities, now coupled with our full e-Powertrain capabilities, provides our customers with highly efficient solutions to support their reduced emission and total cost of ownership objectives. And further into this, a key element of our enterprise strategy is to lead in electric propulsion. Accordingly, we continue to strive to develop the best and most innovative solutions. This can only be accomplished by having the right team and, more specifically, the most experienced people.\\nPlease turn with me to slide seven to discuss the most recent step we have taken to strengthen our capabilities in software, controls and engineering services. I am often asked the question: you've been filling out the white space via executing on M&A opportunities and especially in electrification, does Dana have everything that we need? And my response to that question has been something like: we always keep our eyes open, especially in the area of software, controls and systems. Accordingly, earlier this month, Dana acquired Rational Motion GmbH, a company with a rich history, and proven technical expertise in software, controls and system integration for electric vehicles. With more than 10 years of proven capability and drawing on many decades of experience from its talented lineup of engineers, the skills and expertise of the Rational Motion team will increase our localized support for   Markets -- Analyst\\nOkay. And then last one is just on Hyliion. So you're providing the e-Axle Spicer product. Is there a major difference between what you would provide and what you're doing for them, which is effectively a retrofit hybrid solution versus what you would provide to like a brand-new sort of OE, whether either it's BEV or fuel cell, the axle solution? Or is it basically the same product?\\nJames Kamsickas -- Chairman / Chief Executive Officer of Dana Incorporated\\nNo, it's a good point. It's basically the same product. So the three-in-one system with the motor, the inverter and the gears is essentially comparable to what you'd see on a fully electrified vehicle. Most of the difference in the powertrain would be north of that. So into the size of the battery pack, the controls, all of that would be different in the e-Power system. So the e-Propulsion system is very comparable.\\nJoseph Spak -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\\nOkay, thank you very much.\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nSure. Thanks, Joe.\\nOperator\\nYour next question is from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Please go ahead.\\nBrian Johnson -- Barclays -- Analyst\\nYes. Just the final housekeeping talk question. So between when you gave your guidance for adjusted FCF breakeven to use when you updated it at a June conference, was it really the swing in inventory or other parts of working capital that was the big difference in your thinking?\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. Yes, Brian, just to be specific. At the end of the first quarter, we said that adjusted EBITDA would be about breakeven, but we did say that we would be a use of cash in the quarter. We specified that a bit more midway through the quarter to make sure it was clear that people knew that it would be slightly more than what we saw in Q1. And you're right, the primary driver is we didn't have a crystal ball to when production was going to go down and come back up, so we tried to clarify that the inventory reduction really happened in the month of June when customer schedules were really back up and running, and we could bleed off some of the inventory. So you got it. It was the cash use in the quarter is driven by that. We're going to see the cash benefit of the inventory reduction in June, and inventories are going to come down in the third quarter as well, too. So the combination of that will help augment the cash.\\nBrian Johnson -- Barclays -- Analyst\\nAnd as a big a difference, was it raw mass, finished goods, work in process or kind of all of the above?\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nNo, you're right. It's really across the board. Days on hand are going to come down across most categories because demand is lower than when we started pre crisis. So you'll see adjustments across the board.\\nBrian Johnson -- Barclays -- Analyst\\nOkay. And second and sort of similar to the last question. But if you compare your European e-truck win to the business you're doing with your joint venture partner in North America for Class eight Hyliion, what's the additional Dana content? And in particular, where is their software or electronic content that could offer better margin profiles?\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nSure. So the real difference between the two on those two pages is the what we refer to as the e-Power system. So all the battery pack, the battery management system, all of the auxiliaries would be included in the e-Power system. So the win in Europe includes those. And obviously, that's much higher content, very high-value content. But just remind you that in the e-Propulsion system, it also includes all the software and controls in the inverter to manage the moving of the vehicle. So there's good content in both, but certainly, there's greater content in the e-Power system. And in the case of Hyliion, they have that part of the system, and we're providing a propulsion system. So a great opportunity for us compared to a traditio  able to begin restarting production until May. The initial May production ramp-up in the U.S. and a few other countries was just a bit slower than we had expected. But since then, we've seen a steady increase in demand as nearly all of our customers are back online. As a direct result of the global shutdowns, sales for the second quarter were $1.1 billion, just over 50% decline from the second quarter last year. As depicted in the lower left side of the slide, April saw a majority of the shutdown impact. We saw an 83% improvement in May as operations began to restart and further an 84% improvement in June as demand continued to improve. Through a combination of cost management actions and efficiently restarting our operations, we ended the quarter with nearly breakeven adjusted EBITDA and a slight adjusted EPS loss.\\nDespite the challenges, we had several highlights in the second quarter as we pivoted to restarting and reengaging the business. To begin with, all our operations have safely and successfully reopened, and we continue to win new business, notably on new electric vehicle programs. We also continue to invest in EV growth through both targeted acquisitions of key capabilities and strategically partnering with industry leaders to bring new technologies to the market. But it's not just on hybrid and electric vehicle programs where Dana is growing. Perhaps you had a chance to virtually watch one of the most highly anticipated and exciting vehicle debuts of the year, the all-new Ford Bronco. The Dana brand is well-known to consumers in the off-road space because, for decades, we delivered the most durable and robust driveline products capable of handling the rugged terrain that these vehicles experience. In other words, with Dana, it's more than the products alone. It's also about brand loyalty and the consumer experience. Moving to slide five, I'd like to talk about how we've successfully restarted our operations. Starting in the left-hand third of the page, as you can imagine, restarting approximately 150 Dana manufacturing and technical facilities was challenging enough, but then you factor in the execution required to ensure supply chain continuity from our Tier one integrated global supply chain across nearly 50 countries. I cannot possibly thank the Dana team and our supply partners enough for their amazing and continued efforts in helping us safely bring our operations back online around the world. They have committed countless hours establishing and sharing best practices and especially from the initial high-impact COVID areas, such as China and Italy, and collaborating to ensure that everyone stayed safe as we brought high-volume manufacturing back online quickly and efficiently.\\nLooking to the center of the page, approximately six weeks ago, we started to ramp up operations in line with our customer start-up schedules, most aggressively in the light vehicle North America market and global agricultural markets. As a reminder, this was all occurring while Dana never stopped operation in what was characterized as essential businesses such as aftermarket and industrial products, thus making our operational challenge, let's say, that much more interesting. Specific to the light vehicle North America markets, throughout May, there was uncertainty as to how fast the customers would be able to restart and when the supply operations would be permitted to resume, especially in Mexico. In the end, the May ramp-up was somewhat slower than expected, but ultimately, all operations came back up at a very good cadence. As we moved into June, we experienced accelerating customer demand as they looked to replenish low dealer inventories. In addition, many of our customers have indicated that they will have limited or no summer shutdowns. In our European and South African operations, our light vehicle customers started a little slower, but they, too, have largely returned, not quite to pre-COVID volumes but to reasonable volume levels. Pivoting to our commercial vehicle customers in North America, they, too, restarted in Ma  Markets -- Analyst\\nOkay. And then last one is just on Hyliion. So you're providing the e-Axle Spicer product. Is there a major difference between what you would provide and what you're doing for them, which is effectively a retrofit hybrid solution versus what you would provide to like a brand-new sort of OE, whether either it's BEV or fuel cell, the axle solution?

So a great opportunity for us compared to a traditio nal vehicle, but there are some differences between the 2, as you noted.\\nBrian Johnson -- Barclays -- Analyst\\nAnd just a follow-up. I mean you have a focus on Class five to 7. But when you get into that, are any Class 5s used for last-mile delivery and if would those go electric? And then when you look at the next thing down since you do provide sort of the 3/4-ton truck and many of the traditional van platforms in North America were built off of that, would you see even though you're focused would you see going into the LCB kind of larger than market as those electrify?\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. No, I think that's I think you have the right assessment. You could see medium-duty vehicles being used for a lot of those applications that are being electrified. So I think broadly, you're correct there. And absolutely, that has been our target market because we think the duty cycle for the applications those are used for is attractive economically to be electrified. So that's why we put so much energy and effort in that segment.\\nJames Kamsickas -- Chairman / Chief Executive Officer of Dana Incorporated\\nOkay. This is Jim. Thanks, everybody, for calling in today and for really good questions and dialogue. Appreciate that very much. A quick shout out or extension of my appreciation recognition for our light vehicle group and, for that matter, our off-road enthusiast group, leading us to what I call value creation for our customers, an example of the new Bronco family of vehicles, but even more so to the overall SUV high-performance market, at least as we describe it. I'd like to call it, business school 101. It's certainly better to grow the pie than it is to carve up the existing size of the pie. That's an exciting market, and our decades of experience at Moab and off-road enthusiast activities, all those learnings that keep coming back to learnings are critical in our product design, critical in our customer engagement and so forth. So thank you all of you.\\nMoving on quickly to the relative to electrification, new energy preparedness, as all of us would agree, who knows exactly where things are going to stop and end up and who does what and all that stuff, infrastructure, readiness, etc, etc? But from our standpoint, we know what our strengths are, and our strengths are to have great people, people finding a better way, miles on the road. How long the people or kilometers on the road for that matter, how long the people actually been doing this? What is their experience? What are their lessons learned? All these learnings, all of these capabilities roll over into, again, who knows what's going to be next in new energy, but we know we're going to have markets and area work platforms or buses or underground mining or medium-duty last mile or whatever it is. All of it's shared, all of it's tied, and it's how our business model is coming together. So thanks, everybody, for your time and attention. We look forward to talking to you at the next opportunity.\\nOperator\\n[Operator Closing Remarks]\\nDuration: 63 minutes\\nCall participants:\\nCraig Barber -- Senior Director of Investor Relations and Strategic Planning\\nJames Kamsickas -- Chairman / Chief Executive Officer of Dana Incorporated\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nAileen Smith -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\nDan Levy -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\\nJoseph Beninati -- Oppenheimer -- Analyst\\nJames Picariello -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst\\nRod Lache -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\nEmmanuel Rosner -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\\nRyan Brinkman -- JPMorgan -- Analyst\\nJoseph Spak -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\\nBrian Johnson -- Barclays -- Analyst\\nMore DAN analysis\\nAll earnings call transcripts\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n ctive than ever as our operating challenges are required in the manufacturing environment. For example, as we adjusted shop floor operations to support social distancing protocols, we have ensured that all processes are revalidated to ensure that product and process characteristics meet our customers' requirements. Of course, this much translates over into new product launches as illustrated in the bottom right-hand corner of the page. We continue to see minimal delays in new product launches for future programs. Furthermore, to continue the steady stream of new product launches in the future, we continue to make investments in new product technology to support our customers' needs as they move from internal-combustion engine to electrified vehicles, which will drive growth across the businesses we serve. Now turning to slide six. I'd like to share some exciting news about another new electrification program we are working on. Our customers continue to recognize a strong value proposition for turnkey suppliers with full e-Powertrain capabilities. I will briefly remind the audience that what I mean by complete e-Powertrain capabilities. As you can see in the bottom left-hand side of the page, Dana, of course, has the e-Propulsion system capabilities, including the motor, inverter and driveline. Moving to the right, we also provide power electronics and battery system to complete the full e-Powertrain system.\\nBy having all of these capabilities in house, Dana, including our e-thermal competency is the only supplier with complete e-Powertrain supply capability, thus enabling us to partner closely with our customers to provide optimized and efficient solutions to meet their needs. Specific to the presentation page and announcing the exciting new business award, we were recently sourced the e-Powertrain by a major European commercial truck manufacturer for a new battery electric medium-duty truck that will be used for urban and regional product distribution. The vehicle production is slated to start next year. The 0-emissions electric truck will be equipped with the Dana content and upfitted to the chassis. We'll supply the e-Powertrain system, which generates and stores and manages the energy for the vehicle, consisting of the battery packs and the electrified auxiliary systems. The vehicle will also utilize the Dana CO300 inverter as well as what we describe as a SUMO HD motor coupled to a Dana driveshaft. Dana-developed software and controls will run the diagnostics and telemetry of the complete system. As the global demand for fuel-efficient, low-emission vehicles continue to expand, our ability to leverage our long-standing leadership in truck driveline capabilities, now coupled with our full e-Powertrain capabilities, provides our customers with highly efficient solutions to support their reduced emission and total cost of ownership objectives. And further into this, a key element of our enterprise strategy is to lead in electric propulsion. Accordingly, we continue to strive to develop the best and most innovative solutions. This can only be accomplished by having the right team and, more specifically, the most experienced people.\\nPlease turn with me to slide seven to discuss the most recent step we have taken to strengthen our capabilities in software, controls and engineering services. I am often asked the question: you've been filling out the white space via executing on M&A opportunities and especially in electrification, does Dana have everything that we need? And my response to that question has been something like: we always keep our eyes open, especially in the area of software, controls and systems. Accordingly, earlier this month, Dana acquired Rational Motion GmbH, a company with a rich history, and proven technical expertise in software, controls and system integration for electric vehicles. With more than 10 years of proven capability and drawing on many decades of experience from its talented lineup of engineers, the skills and expertise of the Rational Motion team will increase our localized support for   able to begin restarting production until May. The initial May production ramp-up in the U.S. and a few other countries was just a bit slower than we had expected. But since then, we've seen a steady increase in demand as nearly all of our customers are back online. As a direct result of the global shutdowns, sales for the second quarter were $1.1 billion, just over 50% decline from the second quarter last year. As depicted in the lower left side of the slide, April saw a majority of the shutdown impact. We saw an 83% improvement in May as operations began to restart and further an 84% improvement in June as demand continued to improve. Through a combination of cost management actions and efficiently restarting our operations, we ended the quarter with nearly breakeven adjusted EBITDA and a slight adjusted EPS loss.\\nDespite the challenges, we had several highlights in the second quarter as we pivoted to restarting and reengaging the business. To begin with, all our operations have safely and successfully reopened, and we continue to win new business, notably on new electric vehicle programs. We also continue to invest in EV growth through both targeted acquisitions of key capabilities and strategically partnering with industry leaders to bring new technologies to the market.

Moving to slide five, I'd like to talk about how we've successfully restarted our operations. Starting in the left-hand third of the page, as you can imagine, restarting approximately 150 Dana manufacturing and technical facilities was challenging enough, but then you factor in the execution required to ensure supply chain continuity from our Tier one integrated global supply chain across nearly 50 countries.

Pivoting to our commercial vehicle customers in North America, they, too, restarted in Ma le for everybody in the world, whatever you want to pick, six, eight weeks. You could argue that launches are delayed a little bit by that amount, but that's not substantial anyway. Back to your supply chain piece of it, you're right. That's a good observation that you don't have as much history on that, but I don't think by accident that our acquisition and roll-up of various electrified assets out there, people that have been doing some form of electric vehicles and components for well over decades, such as obviously, TM4, Ashwoods. The list goes on, SME, etc, and even today's announcement on Rational Motion, the best of the best supply base they've worked with. We're working with them, and we're working off of that to build up the most sophisticated and robust supply chain we can.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from the line of James Picariello with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\\nJames Picariello -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst\\nHey, good morning guys.\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nGood morning.\\nJames Picariello -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst\\nIf we compare your cost structure next year to 2019 as a base, excluding any impact from acquisitions, is there a structural cost savings number we should be considering for 2021? Or would that maybe just be captured in a mid-20% incremental margin contribution?\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. At this point, we're not giving a specific number, but we would indicate that of structural cost actions taken in the second quarter. Some of them will be permanent. It won't be insignificant. So we do think it's going to be something that's going to help the margins be higher on the upswing or the incrementals to be higher than they would have been prior to that. So certainly, there's a combination. There are a number of temporary actions that we referred to, but there are some permanent ones as well there. And as we get toward the end of the year and start providing an outlook for next year, we'll provide some more color on that.\\nJames Picariello -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst\\nOkay. Got it. And as we think about your backlog, new business backlog contribution for the back half and maybe within the context of the full year, right, the original guide of $350 million, just wondering if there's any order of magnitude or color you could provide on your thoughts. It does seem as though you're seeing minimal launch delays for new programs. Just any color.\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nYes, I think that's right. The only color we'd give there is what we shared before, which is the reduction of the backlog is going to be pretty much in line with what we're seeing in our overall change in sales. So certainly, the dollar amount is going to be lower by a comparable amount. As Jim mentioned, the program shifts are relatively insignificant at this point, and we still expect to have a pretty similar cadence of launches going into next year that we would have expected earlier this year.\\nJames Picariello -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst\\nHave you worked with Rational Motion in the past? And today from a vehicle mix or customer channel standpoint, who have they been working with?\\nJames Kamsickas -- Chairman / Chief Executive Officer of Dana Incorporated\\nGood question, by the way. The first part of the question, I'd give you a kind of a yes, but answer to it. Yes, via our TM4 team that we acquired whatever it was 1.5 years ago or so, they can literally finish each other's sentences. They were essentially the outlet for TM4 in Europe for all the activities, anywhere from quoting to design to whatever the case may be. And their background and back to your engineering question, if that's what we call it in products background, actually, they started and spent a large portion of their early days in their business tied into Formula E racing, in particular with Toyota, and then into a multiple of other products. And you can see some of those hosted pict n, just knowing what that means for you guys potentially from a content per vehicle perspective on the commercial side.\\nJames Kamsickas -- Chairman / Chief Executive Officer of Dana Incorporated\\nI can only go based on the inputs I have, of course, in answering the question. It doesn't mean I have a crystal ball for everybody, all the OEMs' capital allocation plans and everything else. But at least from my chair, our chairs, really, it's nothing's changed. Every program we're working on, everyone we're quoting, everything we're hearing or seeing is still steady as you go. That's a direct answer to a question much better than I did earlier. So I hope that answers.\\nRyan Brinkman -- JPMorgan -- Analyst\\nVery good, thank you.\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nSure. Thanks.\\nOperator\\nYour next question is from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\\nJoseph Spak -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\\nThanks everyone. Maybe just some follow-ups on some topics that were already brought up. The first is on slide 15, I think you sort of talked about, I guess, maybe a little bit more negativity on Class 8s as versus prior a competitor of you yesterday has talked pretty positively about the September quarter build and being above the third-party forecasts, and I think we've even seen some positive revisions there. So can you just tell us what you are seeing in your conversations with customers? Because there's a little bit of at odds with some of the other commentary out there.\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nSure. I think in the prepared remarks, what we indicated was we are seeing the orders, the same information that the orders are getting a bit better. We're not necessarily seeing that as a meaningful impact to our production schedules compared to what we were anticipating, but certainly, some improvement will take. I think we're probably just remaining a bit cautious. We anticipated this year on Class eight was going to be a soft year coming into it, and obviously, the current dynamics have only exacerbated that. So I think just generally, we're a bit more cautious. The other thing is, as a reminder, the medium-duty segment for us in commercial vehicle is important, and that has been quite a bit softer than we would have started thought at the beginning of the year, and the recovery there is going a bit slower. So I would say it's a combination of our views on heavy- and medium-duty vehicles in that segment that put us in a place where we're a bit cautious on the commercial vehicle segment.\\nJoseph Spak -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\\nOkay. And Jim, thanks for the good explanation about Rational Motion. I guess I'm just still trying to wrap my head around a little bit more. Is this really more for now, at least of the way we should think about it as sort of like in engineering acquihire, so you get better competency internally about how these systems work. And then eventually, you can sort of help your customers. Or did I misinterpret that?\\nJames Kamsickas -- Chairman / Chief Executive Officer of Dana Incorporated\\nYes. I think you're absolutely all over it, very usual. It is. I've said it since the very beginning, people thought you're about acquisitions and electrification and top line and OK, sure. Yes. All right. Not really, though. I mean it's really more about being ahead of the curve, getting the best people with the best talent, so the learning structure organization, you're learning structure organization, not sitting in your headquarters, but sitting at your distributed technology centers around the world and being prepared for that. Because, ultimately, one thing about vehicles and any industrial systems, if you want to call it, the winner comes back to the efficiencies between the moving parts and the systems and controls, and all those learnings and ability to go through this is what's really important from future efficiencies and best systems that are out there. So to answer your question, yes.\\nJoseph Spak -- RBC Capital n, just knowing what that means for you guys potentially from a content per vehicle perspective on the commercial side.\\nJames Kamsickas -- Chairman / Chief Executive Officer of Dana Incorporated\\nI can only go based on the inputs I have, of course, in answering the question.

I think you're absolutely all over it, very usual. It is. I've said it since the very beginning, people thought you're about acquisitions and electrification and top line and OK, sure. Yes. All right. Not really, though. I mean it's really more about being ahead of the curve, getting the best people with the best talent, so the learning structure organization, you're learning structure organization, not sitting in your headquarters, but sitting at your distributed technology centers around the world and being prepared for that. Because, ultimately, one thing about vehicles and any industrial systems, if you want to call it, the winner comes back to the efficiencies between the moving parts and the systems and controls, and all those learnings and ability to go through this is what's really important from future efficiencies and best systems that are out there. So to answer your question, yes.\\nJoseph Spak -- RBC Capital European-based customers as well as further strengthen our global development of software and controls for complete electric vehicle integration. And by the way, the timing of the acquisition and Dana winning the new program in Europe is not a coincidence. The former Rational Motion team members will be involved in the launch of the previously announced new European electric truck as well as numerous other projects that Dana is working on.\\nPlease turn with me to slide eight to learn more about new hybrid electric Class eight truck application hitting the market this year. There's been a lot of buzz about Hyliion, a company we first told you about earlier last year. We are excited about the opportunity or market opportunity through our strategic partnership and equity-linked investment with Hyliion. Earlier this year, Hyliion delivered the first of three hybrid Class eight vehicles to a leading transportation services provider with the remaining vehicles slated to be delivered later this year. Through this partnership, Dana is their source for the e-Propulsion system, including traditional driveline components as well as fully integrated e-Axles, which include motors, inverters, controls, gear boxes as well as thermal management technologies. The Hyliion system converts a traditional 6 times2 into hybrid by adding Dana's e-Propulsion system. The system allows for easy installation and simple servicing. It's an engine-type agnostic and can be installed on any Class eight vehicle from any manufacturer. This is another example of how we are committed to helping our customers navigate the electrification journey with industry-leading technologies and programs. Thanks to our strategic partners such as this one, we have a unique opportunity to implement high-value proposition, long-haul solutions that revolutionize power commands and help our customers to meet their sustainability goals.\\nPlease turn with me to slide nine to hear about more exciting and highly anticipated vehicle debuts in years. As I'm sure you're aware, Ford revealed or unveiled its 2021 Built Wild, two-door and four-door, mono Broncos and the new Bronco Sport a few weeks ago. You may not be aware of this, but Dana's involvement with the Bronco program dates back to its initial launch in 1966, and we are excited once again to be collaborating with Ford to offer a robust suite of advanced driveline, sealing and thermal management technologies for this exciting new vehicle family. Our featured technologies in the Ford Bronco include the Dana 44 AdvanTEK solid rear axle and the Dana AdvanTEK independent front axle. From those who want to want extreme performance, there is an optional upgrade to the Dana 44 AdvanTEK independent front axle. All of these axles are available in the Spicer, pro forma track electric locking differentials. The Bronco also uses a Spicer rear drive shaft with Dana-designed constant velocity joints and our industry-leading thermal management and sealing technologies. We first announced this program win back in 2017. In fact, Ford has stated that they selected Dana's axles even before they decided the frame of the vehicle, and we are looking forward to seeing the Bronco out on the trail. We're not able to announce at the time was Dana's driveline system would be featured on the all-new Ford Bronco sport.\\nThis new vehicle will be equipped with Dana Spicer AdvanTEK ultra rear axle and Spicer SmartConnect disconnecting 4 times4 system. Dana and Ford have a long history together, and we're proud to once again be partnering on these exciting models, which are part of one of the fastest-growing vehicle segments in the United States. In fact, in 2019, sales of the SUVs in United States were nearly 50%. As our customers increase their offerings in this segment, we are looking to leverage driveline solutions to deliver the best on-road experience as well as the high-performance pickups and SUVs used for off roading as well. Dana supported this growing segment and their desire to enhance, customize and personalize their vehicles with aftermarket solu ures recently. They've worked on the coordination and integration of various electrified components. So a really good background and history.\\nJames Picariello -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst\\nOkay. Sure.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\\nRod Lache -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\nGood morning, everybody. A lot of focus, obviously, on the Bronco, and I wasn't aware of your position on the Bronco Sport. I was hoping you might just be able to speak to us a little bit more broadly about the backlog of new business that you're looking at in light vehicle as you look out to 2021. And then also on the new business front, just given this intensity of activity that we're hearing about in EV programs, have you updated your view on the trajectory that you see for EV growth for you? How big this could be at a certain point in time?\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nSure. Just to the backlog, specifically on the Bronco, Rod, all three of the vehicle variants and the technology that Jim talked about just a few moments ago, have been contemplated in our backlog. So that's been a part of our calculation the entire time. We really think that the trends in consumers shifting from cars or sedans to full-size SUV and many of them that have off-road capability is really moving in the right direction. So we're really excited about the launch of that product. On the electrified side, as we highlighted earlier this year, there's a more significant portion of our backlog that's now in electrified vehicles. Certainly the one that we announced earlier on the call will be accretive to that. It was not in the backlog when we started this year, and we continue to see more opportunity to grow our backlog on the electrified products, particularly in the heavy vehicle market. So a lot of activity there, as Jim mentioned, in last-mile or urban delivery of medium-duty vehicles. But then also, we're really excited about the potential for the through-the-road hybrid via Hyliion that could come to the Class eight over-the-road applications in the coming years as well, too.\\nRod Lache -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\nAny comment on just the magnitude of the opportunity for you? I know that you provided some color on the Investor Day, but that was a while ago. And sounds like the opportunity is bigger than what you'd suggested back then.\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. There's certainly a tremendous amount of opportunity, but we remain pretty convicted in our ability to deliver $0.5 billion of electrified sales by 2023. And all of the programs that we've talked about so far, keep us on track to that. And probably early next year, we'll take a look at refreshing those projections. But at this point, we're tracking pretty well.\\nRod Lache -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\nOkay. And just lastly, your slide 15, you gave some sort of directional color on commercial vehicle off-highway. Can you just maybe be a little bit more specific on what your expectations are for those? Or what the I don't know, is there a the different colors for those arrows, maybe you could just give us a little bit of a key, a decoder key to magnitude.\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nSure. From the indications we put on that page, that's really how the third quarter is shaping up compared to what we expected. So what we were trying to give a sense is that the light truck market in North America is certainly that green represents that it's performing better than we would have expected. So sales of those vehicles during the second quarter remained stronger than we would have anticipated. There was little production in April and May with some production coming back in June. So inventory levels for our key platforms are better than we expected. Demand in July for those products would have been higher. So we're just indicating that the light truck market is coming back a bit better. Commercial vehicle, whether it's Class ei ures recently. They've worked on the coordination and integration of various electrified components. So a really good background and history.\\nJames Picariello -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst\\nOkay. Sure.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\\nRod Lache -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\nGood morning, everybody.

So we're just indicating that the light truck market is coming back a bit better. Commercial vehicle, whether it's Class ei  Markets -- Analyst\\nOkay. And then last one is just on Hyliion. So you're providing the e-Axle Spicer product. Is there a major difference between what you would provide and what you're doing for them, which is effectively a retrofit hybrid solution versus what you would provide to like a brand-new sort of OE, whether either it's BEV or fuel cell, the axle solution? Or is it basically the same product?\\nJames Kamsickas -- Chairman / Chief Executive Officer of Dana Incorporated\\nNo, it's a good point. It's basically the same product. So the three-in-one system with the motor, the inverter and the gears is essentially comparable to what you'd see on a fully electrified vehicle. Most of the difference in the powertrain would be north of that. So into the size of the battery pack, the controls, all of that would be different in the e-Power system. So the e-Propulsion system is very comparable.\\nJoseph Spak -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\\nOkay, thank you very much.\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nSure. Thanks, Joe.\\nOperator\\nYour next question is from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Please go ahead.\\nBrian Johnson -- Barclays -- Analyst\\nYes. Just the final housekeeping talk question. So between when you gave your guidance for adjusted FCF breakeven to use when you updated it at a June conference, was it really the swing in inventory or other parts of working capital that was the big difference in your thinking?\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. Yes, Brian, just to be specific. At the end of the first quarter, we said that adjusted EBITDA would be about breakeven, but we did say that we would be a use of cash in the quarter. We specified that a bit more midway through the quarter to make sure it was clear that people knew that it would be slightly more than what we saw in Q1. And you're right, the primary driver is we didn't have a crystal ball to when production was going to go down and come back up, so we tried to clarify that the inventory reduction really happened in the month of June when customer schedules were really back up and running, and we could bleed off some of the inventory. So you got it. It was the cash use in the quarter is driven by that. We're going to see the cash benefit of the inventory reduction in June, and inventories are going to come down in the third quarter as well, too. So the combination of that will help augment the cash.\\nBrian Johnson -- Barclays -- Analyst\\nAnd as a big a difference, was it raw mass, finished goods, work in process or kind of all of the above?\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nNo, you're right. It's really across the board. Days on hand are going to come down across most categories because demand is lower than when we started pre crisis. So you'll see adjustments across the board.\\nBrian Johnson -- Barclays -- Analyst\\nOkay. And second and sort of similar to the last question. But if you compare your European e-truck win to the business you're doing with your joint venture partner in North America for Class eight Hyliion, what's the additional Dana content? And in particular, where is their software or electronic content that could offer better margin profiles?\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nSure. So the real difference between the two on those two pages is the what we refer to as the e-Power system. So all the battery pack, the battery management system, all of the auxiliaries would be included in the e-Power system. So the win in Europe includes those. And obviously, that's much higher content, very high-value content. But just remind you that in the e-Propulsion system, it also includes all the software and controls in the inverter to manage the moving of the vehicle. So there's good content in both, but certainly, there's greater content in the e-Power system. And in the case of Hyliion, they have that part of the system, and we're providing a propulsion system. So a great opportunity for us compared to a traditio ctive than ever as our operating challenges are required in the manufacturing environment. For example, as we adjusted shop floor operations to support social distancing protocols, we have ensured that all processes are revalidated to ensure that product and process characteristics meet our customers' requirements. Of course, this much translates over into new product launches as illustrated in the bottom right-hand corner of the page. We continue to see minimal delays in new product launches for future programs. Furthermore, to continue the steady stream of new product launches in the future, we continue to make investments in new product technology to support our customers' needs as they move from internal-combustion engine to electrified vehicles, which will drive growth across the businesses we serve. Now turning to slide six. I'd like to share some exciting news about another new electrification program we are working on. Our customers continue to recognize a strong value proposition for turnkey suppliers with full e-Powertrain capabilities. I will briefly remind the audience that what I mean by complete e-Powertrain capabilities. As you can see in the bottom left-hand side of the page, Dana, of course, has the e-Propulsion system capabilities, including the motor, inverter and driveline. Moving to the right, we also provide power electronics and battery system to complete the full e-Powertrain system.\\nBy having all of these capabilities in house, Dana, including our e-thermal competency is the only supplier with complete e-Powertrain supply capability, thus enabling us to partner closely with our customers to provide optimized and efficient solutions to meet their needs. Specific to the presentation page and announcing the exciting new business award, we were recently sourced the e-Powertrain by a major European commercial truck manufacturer for a new battery electric medium-duty truck that will be used for urban and regional product distribution. The vehicle production is slated to start next year. The 0-emissions electric truck will be equipped with the Dana content and upfitted to the chassis. We'll supply the e-Powertrain system, which generates and stores and manages the energy for the vehicle, consisting of the battery packs and the electrified auxiliary systems. The vehicle will also utilize the Dana CO300 inverter as well as what we describe as a SUMO HD motor coupled to a Dana driveshaft. Dana-developed software and controls will run the diagnostics and telemetry of the complete system. As the global demand for fuel-efficient, low-emission vehicles continue to expand, our ability to leverage our long-standing leadership in truck driveline capabilities, now coupled with our full e-Powertrain capabilities, provides our customers with highly efficient solutions to support their reduced emission and total cost of ownership objectives. And further into this, a key element of our enterprise strategy is to lead in electric propulsion. Accordingly, we continue to strive to develop the best and most innovative solutions. This can only be accomplished by having the right team and, more specifically, the most experienced people.\\nPlease turn with me to slide seven to discuss the most recent step we have taken to strengthen our capabilities in software, controls and engineering services. I am often asked the question: you've been filling out the white space via executing on M&A opportunities and especially in electrification, does Dana have everything that we need? And my response to that question has been something like: we always keep our eyes open, especially in the area of software, controls and systems. Accordingly, earlier this month, Dana acquired Rational Motion GmbH, a company with a rich history, and proven technical expertise in software, controls and system integration for electric vehicles. With more than 10 years of proven capability and drawing on many decades of experience from its talented lineup of engineers, the skills and expertise of the Rational Motion team will increase our localized support for  n, just knowing what that means for you guys potentially from a content per vehicle perspective on the commercial side.\\nJames Kamsickas -- Chairman / Chief Executive Officer of Dana Incorporated\\nI can only go based on the inputs I have, of course, in answering the question. It doesn't mean I have a crystal ball for everybody, all the OEMs' capital allocation plans and everything else. But at least from my chair, our chairs, really, it's nothing's changed. Every program we're working on, everyone we're quoting, everything we're hearing or seeing is still steady as you go. That's a direct answer to a question much better than I did earlier. So I hope that answers.\\nRyan Brinkman -- JPMorgan -- Analyst\\nVery good, thank you.\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nSure. Thanks.\\nOperator\\nYour next question is from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\\nJoseph Spak -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\\nThanks everyone. Maybe just some follow-ups on some topics that were already brought up. The first is on slide 15, I think you sort of talked about, I guess, maybe a little bit more negativity on Class 8s as versus prior a competitor of you yesterday has talked pretty positively about the September quarter build and being above the third-party forecasts, and I think we've even seen some positive revisions there. So can you just tell us what you are seeing in your conversations with customers? Because there's a little bit of at odds with some of the other commentary out there.\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nSure. I think in the prepared remarks, what we indicated was we are seeing the orders, the same information that the orders are getting a bit better. We're not necessarily seeing that as a meaningful impact to our production schedules compared to what we were anticipating, but certainly, some improvement will take. I think we're probably just remaining a bit cautious. We anticipated this year on Class eight was going to be a soft year coming into it, and obviously, the current dynamics have only exacerbated that. So I think just generally, we're a bit more cautious. The other thing is, as a reminder, the medium-duty segment for us in commercial vehicle is important, and that has been quite a bit softer than we would have started thought at the beginning of the year, and the recovery there is going a bit slower. So I would say it's a combination of our views on heavy- and medium-duty vehicles in that segment that put us in a place where we're a bit cautious on the commercial vehicle segment.\\nJoseph Spak -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\\nOkay. And Jim, thanks for the good explanation about Rational Motion. I guess I'm just still trying to wrap my head around a little bit more. Is this really more for now, at least of the way we should think about it as sort of like in engineering acquihire, so you get better competency internally about how these systems work. And then eventually, you can sort of help your customers. Or did I misinterpret that?\\nJames Kamsickas -- Chairman / Chief Executive Officer of Dana Incorporated\\nYes.

There's been a lot of buzz about Hyliion, a company we first told you about earlier last year. We are excited about the opportunity or market opportunity through our strategic partnership and equity-linked investment with Hyliion.

Thanks to our strategic partners such as this one, we have a unique opportunity to implement high-value proposition, long-haul solutions that revolutionize power commands and help our customers to meet their sustainability goals.\\nPlease turn with me to slide nine to hear about more exciting and highly anticipated vehicle debuts in years. As I'm sure you're aware  Dana manufacturing and technical facilities was challenging enough, but then you factor in the execution required to ensure supply chain continuity from our Tier one integrated global supply chain across nearly 50 countries. I cannot possibly thank the Dana team and our supply partners enough for their amazing and continued efforts in helping us safely bring our operations back online around the world. They have committed countless hours establishing and sharing best practices and especially from the initial high-impact COVID areas, such as China and Italy, and collaborating to ensure that everyone stayed safe as we brought high-volume manufacturing back online quickly and efficiently.\\nLooking to the center of the page, approximately six weeks ago, we started to ramp up operations in line with our customer start-up schedules, most aggressively in the light vehicle North America market and global agricultural markets. As a reminder, this was all occurring while Dana never stopped operation in what was characterized as essential businesses such as aftermarket and industrial products, thus making our operational challenge, let's say, that much more interesting. Specific to the light vehicle North America markets, throughout May, there was uncertainty as to how fast the customers would be able to restart and when the supply operations would be permitted to resume, especially in Mexico. In the end, the May ramp-up was somewhat slower than expected, but ultimately, all operations came back up at a very good cadence. As we moved into June, we experienced accelerating customer demand as they looked to replenish low dealer inventories. In addition, many of our customers have indicated that they will have limited or no summer shutdowns. In our European and South African operations, our light vehicle customers started a little slower, but they, too, have largely returned, not quite to pre-COVID volumes but to reasonable volume levels. Pivoting to our commercial vehicle customers in North America, they, too, restarted in May after several weeks of downtime. Obviously, volumes are down from the record highs of the previous years, but there is resiliency there more than some would have predicted. The global off-highway markets have restarted because we restarted across the board with varying run rates depending on the region and the end markets. We continue to see stronger demand in agriculture and weaker demand in construction.\\nAnd as I stated earlier, our aftermarket business continues to operate uninterrupted. As you can imagine, with different end markets ramping up production at different rates, cohesively and consistently executing a very robust global operational and supply chain management system is essential to success. The Dana operational purchasing and supply chain management team did a remarkable job navigating through the ebbs and flows of the dramatic customer requirement changes. And of course, this was not only on a country-by-country basis as the pandemic altered manufacturing around the world, but often on a state-by-state or providence-by-providence basis. Drawing your attention to the center of the page, customer engagement may have slowed for a brief period of time. But today, we are back, albeit in its new normal of digital communications where we left off pre-COVID. Customer satisfaction starts with having great people who have a tremendous passion for creating value for our customers. At Dana, customer satisfaction is in our DNA, and the team is executing product design reviews, product validation testing, launch readiness reviews and all other facets of the business.\\nMost importantly, we are all doing this safely. As you will notice on the right-hand side of the page, coincide with the new normal, we have thoughtfully, not only increased safety protocols in our operations in many ways, we clearly understand that the new normal work environment could result in any manufacturing company deviating away from standardized operating processes. Accordingly, we have also elevated our focus on quality to be more proa ght or medium duty, both of those continues to be soft.\\nAnd if anything, Class 8, it's probably a little bit softer than we would have expected just a couple of months ago. So that's what that arrow is intending to represent. And then off-highway, on balance, across all three segments is probably pretty consistent with what we thought. As we said, ag continued to do reasonably well. But really, construction and mining have been quite soft around the world with the exception of in China where that came back quite strong. So on balance, that's what we were trying to indicate as compared to what we expected, and that all gets to the sense that we think we're going to be 50% better than 50% from a sequential standpoint in Q3 compared to where we were last quarter.\\nRod Lache -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\nOkay, all right, thank you.\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nSure.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.\\nEmmanuel Rosner -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\\nHi, good morning everybody.\\nJames Kamsickas -- Chairman / Chief Executive Officer of Dana Incorporated\\nGood morning.\\nEmmanuel Rosner -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\\nYour third quarter outlook for positive adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow, it seems like a pretty low bar. If your revenue is going to grow more than 50% and decrementals are still in the mid-20s, you can probably do more than, I guess, more than $100 million. So any other factors that we're not thinking about in terms of negative offset? Or is it just are you trying to just stay a little more vague?\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. It's more of the latter, Emmanuel. We were just indicating that, obviously, conditions are improving significantly on the top line, and they will. So we weren't saying we're going to be just above breakeven on both. We're going to generate a significant amount of cash flow in the third quarter based on what we see right now as working capital becomes a headwind or excuse me, tailwind and starts to moves from a headwind to a tailwind in Q3, and we would expect to see strong sequential conversion on the incremental sales. And on a year-over-year basis, it certainly implies that we would still be lower than last year, but we still think those decrementals on a year-over-year basis are going to be in the mid-20s. So we think giving all those points, we're getting enough information to give people a sense of where we are without being too specific.\\nEmmanuel Rosner -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\\nGreat. And then secondly, I was hoping to learn a little bit more about your work and relationship with Hyliion. Can you just go over some of the motivation there? Do you think that natural gas solutions for truck will take off? Or is it sort of a good use of existing capacity that you have? Also curious sort of like how the relationship works and if you're willing to comment on how much did you invest or how much of the company do you own?\\nJames Kamsickas -- Chairman / Chief Executive Officer of Dana Incorporated\\nI'll take the first part, Emmanuel. Thanks for the question. Thanks for joining us today. The one key thing, I don't know that anybody has a crystal ball, but certainly, the OEMs have more of a crystal ball than I would or almost any supplier relative to fuel cell and all that other stuff. What I will tell you is you've often heard me use the word, what is Dana's strategic plan relative to electrification, future mobility, all that, and it's always been these set of words, which just is to be energy-source agnostic in terms of our drivelines and powertrains. And when we're talking about fuel cell vehicles, we're working on plenty of projects that you take our drivelines and they're essentially adaptable for those type of energy sources. So that's kind of that's probably the best answer I'd give you as you're trying to evaluate what's going on at Dana. Jonathan, I don't know if you have anything else?\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive ght or medium duty, both of those continues to be soft.\\nAnd if anything, Class 8, it's probably a little bit softer than we would have expected just a couple of months ago. So that's what that arrow is intending to represent. And then off-highway, on balance, across all three segments is probably pretty consistent with what we thought. As we said, ag continued to do reasonably well. But really, construction and mining have been quite soft around the world with the exception of in China where that came back quite strong. So on balance, that's what we were trying to indicate as compared to what we expected, and that all gets to the sense that we think we're going to be 50% better than 50% from a sequential standpoint in Q3 compared to where we were last quarter.\\nRod Lache -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\nOkay, all right, thank you.\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nSure.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.\\nEmmanuel Rosner -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\\nHi, good morning everybody.\\nJames Kamsickas -- Chairman / Chief Executive Officer of Dana Incorporated\\nGood morning.\\nEmmanuel Rosner -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\\nYour third quarter outlook for positive adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow, it seems like a pretty low bar. If your revenue is going to grow more than 50% and decrementals are still in the mid-20s, you can probably do more than, I guess, more than $100 million. So any other factors that we're not thinking about in terms of negative offset? Or is it just are you trying to just stay a little more vague?\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. It's more of the latter, Emmanuel. We were just indicating that, obviously, conditions are improving significantly on the top line, and they will. So we weren't saying we're going to be just above breakeven on both. We're going to generate a significant amount of cash flow in the third quarter based on what we see right now as working capital becomes a headwind or excuse me, tailwind and starts to moves from a headwind to a tailwind in Q3, and we would expect to see strong sequential conversion on the incremental sales. And on a year-over-year basis, it certainly implies that we would still be lower than last year, but we still think those decrementals on a year-over-year basis are going to be in the mid-20s. So we think giving all those points, we're getting enough information to give people a sense of where we are without being too specific.\\nEmmanuel Rosner -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\\nGreat. And then secondly, I was hoping to learn a little bit more about your work and relationship with Hyliion. Can you just go over some of the motivation there? Do you think that natural gas solutions for truck will take off? Or is it sort of a good use of existing capacity that you have? Also curious sort of like how the relationship works and if you're willing to comment on how much did you invest or how much of the company do you own?\\nJames Kamsickas -- Chairman / Chief Executive Officer of Dana Incorporated\\nI'll take the first part, Emmanuel. Thanks for the question. Thanks for joining us today. The one key thing, I don't know that anybody has a crystal ball, but certainly, the OEMs have more of a crystal ball than I would or almost any supplier relative to fuel cell and all that other stuff. What I will tell you is you've often heard me use the word, what is Dana's strategic plan relative to electrification, future mobility, all that, and it's always been these set of words, which just is to be energy-source agnostic in terms of our drivelines and powertrains. And when we're talking about fuel cell vehicles, we're working on plenty of projects that you take our drivelines and they're essentially adaptable for those type of energy sources. So that's kind of that's probably the best answer I'd give you as you're trying to evaluate what's going on at Dana. Jonathan, I don't know if you have anything else?\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive missions electric truck will be equipped with the Dana content and upfitted to the chassis. We'll supply the e-Powertrain system, which generates and stores and manages the energy for the vehicle, consisting of the battery packs and the electrified auxiliary systems. The vehicle will also utilize the Dana CO300 inverter as well as what we describe as a SUMO HD motor coupled to a Dana driveshaft. Dana-developed software and controls will run the diagnostics and telemetry of the complete system. As the global demand for fuel-efficient, low-emission vehicles continue to expand, our ability to leverage our long-standing leadership in truck driveline capabilities, now coupled with our full e-Powertrain capabilities, provides our customers with highly efficient solutions to support their reduced emission and total cost of ownership objectives. And further into this, a key element of our enterprise strategy is to lead in electric propulsion. Accordingly, we continue to strive to develop the best and most innovative solutions. This can only be accomplished by having the right team and, more specifically, the most experienced people.\\nPlease turn with me to slide seven to discuss the most recent step we have taken to strengthen our capabilities in software, controls and engineering services. I am often asked the question: you've been filling out the white space via executing on M&A opportunities and especially in electrification, does Dana have everything that we need? And my response to that question has been something like: we always keep our eyes open, especially in the area of software, controls and systems. Accordingly, earlier this month, Dana acquired Rational Motion GmbH, a company with a rich history, and proven technical expertise in software, controls and system integration for electric vehicles. With more than 10 years of proven capability and drawing on many decades of experience from its talented lineup of engineers, the skills and expertise of the Rational Motion team will increase our localized support for European-based customers as well as further strengthen our global development of software and controls for complete electric vehicle integration. And by the way, the timing of the acquisition and Dana winning the new program in Europe is not a coincidence. The former Rational Motion team members will be involved in the launch of the previously announced new European electric truck as well as numerous other projects that Dana is working on.\\nPlease turn with me to slide eight to learn more about new hybrid electric Class eight truck application hitting the market this year. There's been a lot of buzz about Hyliion, a company we first told you about earlier last year. We are excited about the opportunity or market opportunity through our strategic partnership and equity-linked investment with Hyliion. Earlier this year, Hyliion delivered the first of three hybrid Class eight vehicles to a leading transportation services provider with the remaining vehicles slated to be delivered later this year. Through this partnership, Dana is their source for the e-Propulsion system, including traditional driveline components as well as fully integrated e-Axles, which include motors, inverters, controls, gear boxes as well as thermal management technologies. The Hyliion system converts a traditional 6 times2 into hybrid by adding Dana's e-Propulsion system. The system allows for easy installation and simple servicing. It's an engine-type agnostic and can be installed on any Class eight vehicle from any manufacturer. This is another example of how we are committed to helping our customers navigate the electrification journey with industry-leading technologies and programs. Thanks to our strategic partners such as this one, we have a unique opportunity to implement high-value proposition, long-haul solutions that revolutionize power commands and help our customers to meet their sustainability goals.\\nPlease turn with me to slide nine to hear about more exciting and highly anticipated vehicle debuts in years. As I'm sure you're aware  able to begin restarting production until May. The initial May production ramp-up in the U.S. and a few other countries was just a bit slower than we had expected. But since then, we've seen a steady increase in demand as nearly all of our customers are back online. As a direct result of the global shutdowns, sales for the second quarter were $1.1 billion, just over 50% decline from the second quarter last year. As depicted in the lower left side of the slide, April saw a majority of the shutdown impact. We saw an 83% improvement in May as operations began to restart and further an 84% improvement in June as demand continued to improve. Through a combination of cost management actions and efficiently restarting our operations, we ended the quarter with nearly breakeven adjusted EBITDA and a slight adjusted EPS loss.\\nDespite the challenges, we had several highlights in the second quarter as we pivoted to restarting and reengaging the business. To begin with, all our operations have safely and successfully reopened, and we continue to win new business, notably on new electric vehicle programs. We also continue to invest in EV growth through both targeted acquisitions of key capabilities and strategically partnering with industry leaders to bring new technologies to the market. But it's not just on hybrid and electric vehicle programs where Dana is growing. Perhaps you had a chance to virtually watch one of the most highly anticipated and exciting vehicle debuts of the year, the all-new Ford Bronco. The Dana brand is well-known to consumers in the off-road space because, for decades, we delivered the most durable and robust driveline products capable of handling the rugged terrain that these vehicles experience. In other words, with Dana, it's more than the products alone. It's also about brand loyalty and the consumer experience. Moving to slide five, I'd like to talk about how we've successfully restarted our operations. Starting in the left-hand third of the page, as you can imagine, restarting approximately 150 Dana manufacturing and technical facilities was challenging enough, but then you factor in the execution required to ensure supply chain continuity from our Tier one integrated global supply chain across nearly 50 countries. I cannot possibly thank the Dana team and our supply partners enough for their amazing and continued efforts in helping us safely bring our operations back online around the world. They have committed countless hours establishing and sharing best practices and especially from the initial high-impact COVID areas, such as China and Italy, and collaborating to ensure that everyone stayed safe as we brought high-volume manufacturing back online quickly and efficiently.\\nLooking to the center of the page, approximately six weeks ago, we started to ramp up operations in line with our customer start-up schedules, most aggressively in the light vehicle North America market and global agricultural markets. As a reminder, this was all occurring while Dana never stopped operation in what was characterized as essential businesses such as aftermarket and industrial products, thus making our operational challenge, let's say, that much more interesting. Specific to the light vehicle North America markets, throughout May, there was uncertainty as to how fast the customers would be able to restart and when the supply operations would be permitted to resume, especially in Mexico. In the end, the May ramp-up was somewhat slower than expected, but ultimately, all operations came back up at a very good cadence. As we moved into June, we experienced accelerating customer demand as they looked to replenish low dealer inventories. In addition, many of our customers have indicated that they will have limited or no summer shutdowns. In our European and South African operations, our light vehicle customers started a little slower, but they, too, have largely returned, not quite to pre-COVID volumes but to reasonable volume levels. Pivoting to our commercial vehicle customers in North America, they, too, restarted in Ma istent demand, we'd be in a position to look at moving back toward a more normal capital repatriation approach.\\nAileen Smith -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\nGreat. And last question, if I may. You've cited a lot of progress you've made on the electrification front in the commercial vehicle market. Another segment that's starting to get a lot of attention in hype is around electric pickups in the light vehicle market with new products coming from GM, Tesla, Ford, etc. Can you remind us where Dana fits in terms of quoting for some of these new programs? Are you heavily involved in these discussions? Or are many of the architectures being pursued more internally at the customer level?\\nJames Kamsickas -- Chairman / Chief Executive Officer of Dana Incorporated\\nAileen, this is Jim. Thanks for the question. Thanks for joining today. I would say it's a mixed bag of things. Certainly, as I've said since the beginning, your initial pull-through was in the bus market. Then it moved into even what we talked about today, more of that last mile. We're involved in one form or another in the light vehicle side, obviously, not here to communicate or announce anything, but I would just say there's plenty of involvement across the board. That's about as much as I can give you.\\nAileen Smith -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\nGreat, thank you very much for the questions.\\nOperator\\nYour next question is from the line of Dan Levy with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\\nDan Levy -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\\nHi, good morning. Thank you, everyone.\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nGood morning. Dan.\\nDan Levy -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\\nSo I wanted to start just with a couple of questions on the decremental. If I look at commercial vehicle, decrementals of only 20%. That's obviously better than the rest of the business. A little color on that. And then similarly, off-highway decremental of 24%, which I would think is lower than what you would get for a segment like that, which is going to typically have higher decremental. So just some color on the decrementals for those two segments, please?\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nSure. Dan, I'd point to two things. The first is both of those business units on the heavy vehicle side have strong aftermarket presences. So in this environment, when OE production was idled, trucks were still on the road and needed to be repaired. So I would say that the aftermarket business, which in both of those is a good and profitable business, help to bolster that a bit. The second thing is that the widespread cost flex actions that I referenced were really across the board. So we ended up with better decrementals in those businesses, partly because of the severity of the cost actions that we took, combined with the support that we received from the aftermarket segment, if you will.\\nDan Levy -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\\nOkay. And then I mean, specific to off-highway, revenue down 40% and you still put out a 10% margin. That's pretty good. It sounds like there's nothing I mean those are the typical cost actions that you're taking to keep that margin intact. And is that indicative that when things finally recover, we can get back to that sort of 16% type margin profile?\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nYes, absolutely. The margin potential of the off-highway business remains very high, particularly because of the acquisitions, the cost synergies that we've achieved and then the strong cost discipline through the operations. The combination of all of those makes that a very attractive segment from a margin standpoint.\\nDan Levy -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\\nGreat. And then just a second question on electrification. For your win on the electric truck program in Europe, could you just give us a sense of how the sourcing decision was made at that customer? Was were they at all considering in-sourcing? Or was it multiple suppliers for the powertrain? Or did they specifically choose you because you mentioned you're the only one out istent demand, we'd be in a position to look at moving back toward a more normal capital repatriation approach.\\nAileen Smith -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\nGreat.

I mean you have a focus on Class five to 7. But when you get into that, are any Class 5s used for last-mile delivery and if would those go electric? And then when you look at the next thing down since you do provide sort of the 3/4-ton truck and many of the traditional van platforms in North America were built off of that, would you see even though you're focused would you see going into the LCB kind of larger than market as those electrify?\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. No, I think that's I think you have the right assessment. You could see medium-duty vehicles being used for a lot of those applications that are being electrified. So I think broadly, you're correct there. And absolutely, that has been our target market because we think the duty cycle for the applications those are used for is attractive economically to be electrified. So that's why we put so much energy and effort in that segment.\\nJames Kamsickas -- Chairman / Chief Executive Officer of Dana Incorporated\\nOkay. This is Jim. Thanks, everybody, for calling in today and for really good questions and dialogue. Appreciate that very much. A quick shout out or extension of my appreciation recognition for our light vehicle group and, for that matter, our off-road enthusiast group, leading us to what I call value creation for our customers, an example of the new Bronco family of vehicles, but even more so to the overall SUV high-performance market, at least as we describe it. I'd like to call it, business school 101. It's certainly better to grow the pie than it is to carve up the existing size of the pie. That's an exciting market, and our decades of experience at Moab and off-road enthusiast activities, all those learnings that keep coming back to learnings are critical in our product design, critical in our customer engagement and so forth. So thank you all of you.\\nMoving on quickly to the relative to electrification, new energy preparedness, as all of us would agree, who knows exactly where things are going to stop and end up and who does what and all that stuff, infrastructure, readiness, etc, etc? But from our standpoint, we know what our strengths are, and our strengths are to have great people, people finding a better way, miles on the road. How long the people or kilometers on the road for that matter, how long the people actually been doing this? What is their experience? What are their lessons learned? All these learnings, all of these capabilities roll over into, again, who knows what's going to be next in new energy, but we know we're going to have markets and area work platforms or buses or underground mining or medium-duty last mile or whatever it is. All of it's shared, all of it's tied, and it's how our business model is coming together. So thanks, everybody, for your time and attention. We look forward to talking to you at the next opportunity.\\nOperator\\n[Operator Closing Remarks]\\nDuration: 63 minutes\\nCall participants:\\nCraig Barber -- Senior Director of Investor Relations and Strategic Planning\\nJames Kamsickas -- Chairman / Chief Executive Officer of Dana Incorporated\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nAileen Smith -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\nDan Levy -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\\nJoseph Beninati -- Oppenheimer -- Analyst\\nJames Picariello -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst\\nRod Lache -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\nEmmanuel Rosner -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\\nRyan Brinkman -- JPMorgan -- Analyst\\nJoseph Spak -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\\nBrian Johnson -- Barclays -- Analyst\\nMore DAN analysis\\nAll earnings call transcripts\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n ures recently. They've worked on the coordination and integration of various electrified components. So a really good background and history.\\nJames Picariello -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst\\nOkay. Sure.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\\nRod Lache -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\nGood morning, everybody. A lot of focus, obviously, on the Bronco, and I wasn't aware of your position on the Bronco Sport. I was hoping you might just be able to speak to us a little bit more broadly about the backlog of new business that you're looking at in light vehicle as you look out to 2021. And then also on the new business front, just given this intensity of activity that we're hearing about in EV programs, have you updated your view on the trajectory that you see for EV growth for you? How big this could be at a certain point in time?\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nSure. Just to the backlog, specifically on the Bronco, Rod, all three of the vehicle variants and the technology that Jim talked about just a few moments ago, have been contemplated in our backlog. So that's been a part of our calculation the entire time. We really think that the trends in consumers shifting from cars or sedans to full-size SUV and many of them that have off-road capability is really moving in the right direction. So we're really excited about the launch of that product. On the electrified side, as we highlighted earlier this year, there's a more significant portion of our backlog that's now in electrified vehicles. Certainly the one that we announced earlier on the call will be accretive to that. It was not in the backlog when we started this year, and we continue to see more opportunity to grow our backlog on the electrified products, particularly in the heavy vehicle market. So a lot of activity there, as Jim mentioned, in last-mile or urban delivery of medium-duty vehicles. But then also, we're really excited about the potential for the through-the-road hybrid via Hyliion that could come to the Class eight over-the-road applications in the coming years as well, too.\\nRod Lache -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\nAny comment on just the magnitude of the opportunity for you? I know that you provided some color on the Investor Day, but that was a while ago. And sounds like the opportunity is bigger than what you'd suggested back then.\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. There's certainly a tremendous amount of opportunity, but we remain pretty convicted in our ability to deliver $0.5 billion of electrified sales by 2023. And all of the programs that we've talked about so far, keep us on track to that. And probably early next year, we'll take a look at refreshing those projections. But at this point, we're tracking pretty well.\\nRod Lache -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\nOkay. And just lastly, your slide 15, you gave some sort of directional color on commercial vehicle off-highway. Can you just maybe be a little bit more specific on what your expectations are for those? Or what the I don't know, is there a the different colors for those arrows, maybe you could just give us a little bit of a key, a decoder key to magnitude.\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nSure. From the indications we put on that page, that's really how the third quarter is shaping up compared to what we expected. So what we were trying to give a sense is that the light truck market in North America is certainly that green represents that it's performing better than we would have expected. So sales of those vehicles during the second quarter remained stronger than we would have anticipated. There was little production in April and May with some production coming back in June. So inventory levels for our key platforms are better than we expected. Demand in July for those products would have been higher. So we're just indicating that the light truck market is coming back a bit better. Commercial vehicle, whether it's Class ei nal vehicle, but there are some differences between the 2, as you noted.\\nBrian Johnson -- Barclays -- Analyst\\nAnd just a follow-up. I mean you have a focus on Class five to 7. But when you get into that, are any Class 5s used for last-mile delivery and if would those go electric? And then when you look at the next thing down since you do provide sort of the 3/4-ton truck and many of the traditional van platforms in North America were built off of that, would you see even though you're focused would you see going into the LCB kind of larger than market as those electrify?\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nYes.

We look forward to talking to you at the next opportunity.\\nOperator\\n[Operator Closing Remarks]\\nDuration: 63 minutes\\nCall participants:\\nCraig Barber -- Senior Director of Investor Relations and Strategic Planning\\nJames Kamsickas -- Chairman / Chief Executive Officer of Dana Incorporated\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nAileen Smith -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\nDan Levy -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\\nJoseph Beninati -- Oppenheimer -- Analyst\\nJames Picariello -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst\\nRod Lache -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\nEmmanuel Rosner -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\\nRyan Brinkman -- JPMorgan -- Analyst\\nJoseph Spak -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\\nBrian Johnson -- Barclays -- Analyst\\nMore DAN analysis\\nAll earnings call transcripts\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nSure. And just a reminder, what we discussed at our Investor Day last year, we've concentrated our investments on the medium-duty segment for fully electrified vehicles because we see more of the near-term opportunities. So the platform that Jim spoke about earlier that we've won in Europe is obviously fits with that. But on the heavy-vehicle side, particularly over-the-road long haul, we believe that hybrid applications are going to carry the day in the near term, as the infrastructure comes in place for fully electrified solutions in the longer run. So we're really excited about the opportunity to get the Spicer electrified e-Propulsion systems on the road in that category. From a financial standpoint, we made an equity-linked investment early last year. There will be a nice return on it, but we're not a major owner in the company. We will have a stake that will give us a nice return, but it's not going to be anything that's overly significant for Dana.\\nEmmanuel Rosner -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\\nOkay. And in terms of the way the relationship work, are you besides for the financial one, are you a Tier three supplier? Do you sell them the Spicer systems? And do you also do the integration? How does that actually work in practice?\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. The partnership has, aside from the financial aspect, has a couple of aspects. Number one, we will be their supplier of the e-Propulsion system. So that electric axle that or driveline that Jim referred to, that had the motor, the inverter and the torque transfer via the gears is going to be the Dana system. That will be combined with their e-Power system, there hybrid controller, the battery pack and all the auxiliaries to provide the full hybrid electric powertrain. The second aspect of the relationship is from a manufacturing standpoint. We have offered our manufacturing expertise to help get the full systems put together, manufactured and delivered to customers. So that's a part of the relationship as well, too.\\nEmmanuel Rosner -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\\nGreat, thank you.\\nOperator\\nYour next question is from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\\nRyan Brinkman -- JPMorgan -- Analyst\\nHi, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask on capital allocation. I think you'd already planned to march toward 1 times leverage or investment-grade credit metrics even prior to the crisis. Of course, now it would take longer. You'd not levered to repurchase shares, thankfully in recent years like some other suppliers. And I see you're still doing bolt-ons. But just maybe broadly, does the experience with coronavirus changed at all how you think about capital allocation or leverage going forward?\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nNo, I don't think so. I think as you noted, it's going to take us a bit longer to get there, given this environment. So as we pre crisis, we had anticipated generating substantial cash flow in the business and intended to use that to delever. That remains our priority, but it's going to take a bit longer. So as we see the second half of this year play out, hopefully, things stabilize and market conditions improve in 2021, you would be seeing us look to generate more meaningful cash flow and use that to continue to delever the balance sheet. And as you noted, the cost of the Rational Motion acquisition is very small. So we'll continue to make smart plays to position ourselves to deliver great electrified products to our customers in the coming years, but you're going to see most of it go toward continuing to get toward that target of the one turn net leverage.\\nRyan Brinkman -- JPMorgan -- Analyst\\nOkay. And then just obviously, there's been a tremendous amount of enthusiasm in the public markets recently with regard to Tesla, Nikola, hopefully, for you in relation to Hyliion soon. Just curious the extent to which you think that coronavirus may delay or accelerate the transition toward sustainable transportatio  Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nSure.

I know that you provided some color on the Investor Day, but that was a while ago. And sounds like the opportunity is bigger than what you'd suggested back then.\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. There's certainly a tremendous amount of opportunity, but we remain pretty convicted in our ability to deliver $0.5 billion of electrified sales by 2023. And all of the programs that we've talked about so far, keep us on track to that. And probably early next year, we'll take a look at refreshing those projections. But at this point, we're tracking pretty well.\\nRod Lache -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\nOkay. And just lastly, your slide 15, you gave some sort of directional color on commercial vehicle off-highway. Can you just maybe be a little bit more specific on what your expectations are for those? Or what the I don't know, is there a the different colors for those arrows, maybe you could just give us a little bit of a key, a decoder key to magnitude.\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nSure. From the indications we put on that page, that's really how the third quarter is shaping up compared to what we expected. So what we were trying to give a sense is that the light truck market in North America is certainly that green represents that it's performing better than we would have expected. So sales of those vehicles during the second quarter remained stronger than we would have anticipated. There was little production in April and May with some production coming back in June. So inventory levels for our key platforms are better than we expected. Demand in July for those products would have been higher. So we're just indicating that the light truck market is coming back a bit better. Commercial vehicle, whether it's Class eight or medium duty, both of those continues to be soft.\\nAnd if anything, Class 8, it's probably a little bit softer than we would have expected just a couple of months ago. So that's what that arrow is intending to represent. And then off-highway, on balance, across all three segments is probably pretty consistent with what we thought. As we said, ag continued to do reasonably well. But really, construction and mining have been quite soft around the world with the exception of in China where that came back quite strong. So on balance, that's what we were trying to indicate as compared to what we expected, and that all gets to the sense that we think we're going to be 50% better than 50% from a sequential standpoint in Q3 compared to where we were last quarter.\\nRod Lache -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\nOkay, all right, thank you.\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nSure.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.\\nEmmanuel Rosner -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\\nHi, good morning everybody.\\nJames Kamsickas -- Chairman / Chief Executive Officer of Dana Incorporated\\nGood morning.\\nEmmanuel Rosner -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\\nYour third quarter outlook for positive adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow, it seems like a pretty low bar. If your revenue is going to grow more than 50% and decrementals are still in the mid-20s, you can probably do more than, I guess, more than $100 million. So any other factors that we're not thinking about in terms of negative offset? Or is it just are you trying to just stay a little more vague?\\nJonathan Collins -- Executive Vice President / Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. It's more of the latter, Emmanuel. We were just indicating that, obviously, conditions are improving significantly on the top line, and they will. So we weren't saying we're going to be just above breakeven on both. We're going to generate a significant amount of cash flow in the third quarter based on what we see gh-the-road hybrid via Hyliion that could come to the Class eight over-the-road applications in the coming years as well, too.\\nRod Lache -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\nAny comment on just the magnitude of the opportunity for you?

We were just indicating that, obviously, conditions are improving significantly on the top line, and they will. So we weren't saying we're going to be just above breakeven on both. We're going to generate a significant amount of cash flow in the third quarter based on what we see missions electric truck will be equipped with the Dana content and upfitted to the chassis. We'll supply the e-Powertrain system, which generates and stores and manages the energy for the vehicle, consisting of the battery packs and the electrified auxiliary systems. The vehicle will also utilize the Dana CO300 inverter as well as what we describe as a SUMO HD motor coupled to a Dana driveshaft. Dana-developed software and controls will run the diagnostics and telemetry of the complete system. As the global demand for fuel-efficient, low-emission vehicles continue to expand, our ability to leverage our long-standing leadership in truck driveline capabilities, now coupled with our full e-Powertrain capabilities, provides our customers with highly efficient solutions to support their reduced emission and total cost of ownership objectives. And further into this, a key element of our enterprise strategy is to lead in electric propulsion. Accordingly, we continue to strive to develop the best and most innovative solutions. This can only be accomplished by having the right team and, more specifically, the most experienced people.\\nPlease turn with me to slide seven to discuss the most recent step we have taken to strengthen our capabilities in software, controls and engineering services. I am often asked the question: you've been filling out the white space via executing on M&A opportunities and especially in electrification, does Dana have everything that we need? And my response to that question has been something like: we always keep our eyes open, especially in the area of software, controls and systems. Accordingly, earlier this month, Dana acquired Rational Motion GmbH, a company with a rich history, and proven technical expertise in software, controls and system integration for electric vehicles. With more than 10 years of proven capability and drawing on many decades of experience from its talented lineup of engineers, the skills and expertise of the Rational Motion team will increase our localized support for European-based customers as well as further strengthen our global development of software and controls for complete electric vehicle integration. And by the way, the timing of the acquisition and Dana winning the new program in Europe is not a coincidence. The former Rational Motion team members will be involved in the launch of the previously announced new European electric truck as well as numerous other projects that Dana is working on.\\nPlease turn with me to slide eight to learn more about new hybrid electric Class eight truck application hitting the market this year. There's been a lot of buzz about Hyliion, a company we first told you about earlier last year. We are excited about the opportunity or market opportunity through our strategic partnership and equity-linked investment with Hyliion. Earlier this year, Hyliion delivered the first of three hybrid Class eight vehicles to a leading transportation services provider with the remaining vehicles slated to be delivered later this year. Through this partnership, Dana is their source for the e-Propulsion system, including traditional driveline components as well as fully integrated e-Axles, which include motors, inverters, controls, gear boxes as well as thermal management technologies. The Hyliion system converts a traditional 6 times2 into hybrid by adding Dana's e-Propulsion system. The system allows for easy installation and simple servicing. It's an engine-type agnostic and can be installed on any Class eight vehicle from any manufacturer. This is another example of how we are committed to helping our customers navigate the electrification journey with industry-leading technologies and programs. Thanks to our strategic partners such as this one, we have a unique opportunity to implement high-value proposition, long-haul solutions that revolutionize power commands and help our customers to meet their sustainability goals.\\nPlease turn with me to slide nine to hear about more exciting and highly anticipated vehicle debuts in years. As I'm sure you're aware gh-the-road hybrid via Hyliion that could come to the Class eight over-the-road applications in the coming years as well, too.\\nRod Lache -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\nAny comment on just the magnitude of the opportunity for you?

Sapiens expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements, whether because of future events, new information, a change in its views or expectations or otherwise.\\nDuring the course of the call today, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures.

A replay of this call will be available after the call on our Investor Relations section of the company's website or via the website link, which is available in the earning release that we published today. As a reminder, the quarterly earnings release was issued before the market opened this morning and it has been posted on the company's website at www.sapiens.com.\\nI will turn the call over to Roni Al-Dor, President and CEO of Sapiens. Roni?\\nRoni Al-Dor -- President & Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you, operator. And thanks to everyone joining today to review our second quarter financial results. I will start with an overview of the quarter, followed by an update on our businesses. Roni Giladi will follow with a detailed review of the second quarter financial results and discuss the updated guidance for the year.\\nOur second quarter results showcase our ability to deliver our solution to our existing customer and onboard new executives [Phonetic] despite the continued impact of COVID restriction globally. Revenue grew by 70% to $93 million driven by growth in North America and EMEA. Last week, we announced the acquisition of Delphi Technology, a leading P&C solution vendor focused on MPL, the medical malpractice markets in North America. Sapiens will support Delphi customer end products, offer additional products and services to their customers and leverage Delphi's knowhow to enhance our P&C CoreSuite to provide holistic multi-line solution for MPL market. We paid $19.5 million for Delphi who had $50 million in revenue in 2019 with an operational loss. Like with our prior acquisition, we plan to integrate Delphi operation with our anticipated acquisition to be accretive in 2021.\\nThe second quarter was productive, thanks to the global Sapiens team effort who delivered new wins go live and upsell in the quarter. FBAlliance Insurance, a Farm Bureau Insurance protection provider select Sapiens for its core P&C platform and advanced analytics to accelerate growth and meet demand for rapid launch of new insurance product. Great Bay Insurance, a New Jersey based homeowner insurance, select Sapiens for cloud-based information for insurance and financial management. Sapiens solution will allow Great Bay to better manage their accounting, finance and reporting system. Implementation of solution is already under way.\\nSince the beginning of 2020, we experienced a growing traction with our DECISION platform in the insurance market. Following the proven track record we still won banks, now we see a growing interest from insurers using this platform for multiple used cases. Two of our new customers publicly shared the adoption of Sapiens DECISION platform. American family insurers will utilize our DECISION platform across various operation companies to create operational efficiency and improving operations. Home Point Financial will be using DECISION to leverage existing technology with the common language between business and domains. Regional wise, across EMEA and APAC, we are building momentum in the countries we operated in, such as U.K., Nordic, Southeast A bad debt provision one-timer in there? Are there operational cost efforts that you've been able to pull forward that you think are lasting?\\nRoni Giladi -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. For sure, we can do this. What we see, we started the year in Q1 of 2020 with 16.1% operational profit. We now see Q3 and Q4 at the level of 17% to 17.3%. So for sure some of the efficiency that we took we can continue for the next half of the year and going forward. And this is why we are passing the 17% operational margin. So the answer for your question is for sure yes.\\nBryan C. Bergin -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\\nOkay. The reason I asked is how should we be thinking about that longer term margin profile on the other side of COVID?\\nRoni Giladi -- Chief Financial Officer\\nI think going forward Sapiens need to continue the 17% plus. Obviously, sometimes we'll do M&A and we are pursuing M&A. So the question is what will be happening with the acquisition of any company. In particular, most of the companies that we acquired so far have lower gross margin than Sapiens. So initial few quarters are basically taking us a little bit down, but over time, and we improve it with all the acquisition that we did, we are being able to do -- to increase them to the level of Sapiens. The same will happen also with Delphi.\\nBryan C. Bergin -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\\nOkay. Thank you.\\nOperator\\nThe next question is from Omri Velvart from Legacy Value Partners. Please go ahead.\\nOmri Velvart -- Legacy Value Partners -- Analyst\\nHi. First of all, congratulations for another great quarter, really impressive. I would like to ask, in your January Investor Conference in Israel, you talked about the workers' compensation product and some major tenders coming in the U.S. I would like to know what's the current situation there with COVID? And other related aspects of this field? You've talked about as a really promising area of your business.\\nRoni Al-Dor -- President & Chief Executive Officer\\nOkay. First of all, good that you listen to all the events. So it's win that you are OK. And this is -- basically this area is really affecting the COVID all the workers' compensation business. So right now based on our information, the government is slowing down. And all the RFP that's planned to send to companies like us is still in process. Every quarter we are getting in the near future, we can get it and we are still waiting. Right now, we don't really believe that we will get in this quarter. Hopefully in the next quarter we will see few of them. But right now it's not -- we are not very optimistic how to get.\\nOmri Velvart -- Legacy Value Partners -- Analyst\\nOkay. Thank you. The next quarter is actually pretty good for me at least. Another question, please. What -- do you see any change in hiring trends and some human capital availability in this environment, after all, you are strong and a stable company, especially in Israel, but also in other key market of yours like U.S. and Europe, etc.?\\nRoni Al-Dor -- President & Chief Executive Officer\\nI can answer the first question in terms of hiring employee. This is better to Sapiens at this point. People -- a lot of start-up are not raising money, so the people are more open and more interesting to come to Sapiens, also because we are bringing a lot of innovation to our product is also help. So overall it's positive and also less people are living Sapiens like in the past, people are moved from one vendor to another. So right now, it's much more stable.\\nAnd again, but it's still for good people. It's difficult like -- but they're generally on the positive side. In terms of the capital...\\nRoni Giladi -- Chief Financial Officer\\nWhat is the question. Omri? The second one.\\nOmri Velvart -- Legacy Value Partners -- Analyst\\nHuman capital, human capital availability.\\nRoni Giladi -- Chief Financial Officer\\nJust to conclude on that, in Q2, we froze all the position that we had. And right now we are in recruiting mode. We have right now 200 open positions in the company that we are looking to recruit. And as Roni mentioned, in terms of Prepared Remarks:\\nOperator\\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by.

I will start with an overview of the quarter, followed by an update on our businesses. Roni Giladi will follow with a detailed review of the second quarter financial results and discuss the updated guidance for the year.\\nOur second quarter results showcase our ability to deliver our solution to our existing customer and onboard new executives [Phonetic] despite the continued impact of COVID restriction globally. Revenue grew by 70% to $93 million driven by growth in North America and EMEA. Last week, we announced the acquisition of Delphi Technology, a leading P&C solution vendor focused on MPL, the medical malpractice markets in North America. Sapiens will support Delphi customer end products, offer additional products and services to their customers and leverage Delphi's knowhow to enhance our P&C CoreSuite to provide holistic multi-line solution for MPL market. We paid $19.5 million for Delphi who had $50 million in revenue in 2019 with an operational loss. Like with our prior acquisition, we plan to integrate Delphi operation with our anticipated acquisition to be accretive in 2021.\\nThe second quarter was productive, thanks to the global Sapiens team effort who delivered new wins go live and upsell in the quarter. FBAlliance Insurance, a Farm Bureau Insurance protection provider select Sapiens for its core P&C platform and advanced analytics to accelerate growth and meet demand for rapid launch of new insurance product. Great Bay Insurance, a New Jersey based homeowner insurance, select Sapiens for cloud-based information for insurance and financial management. Sapiens solution will allow Great Bay to better manage their accounting, finance and reporting system. Implementation of solution is already under way.\\nSince the beginning of 2020, we experienced a growing traction with our DECISION platform in the insurance market. Following the proven track record we still won banks, now we see a growing interest from insurers using this platform for multiple used cases. Two of our new customers publicly shared the adoption of Sapiens DECISION platform. American family insurers will utilize our DECISION platform across various operation companies to create operational efficiency and improving operations. Home Point Financial will be using DECISION to leverage existing technology with the common language between business and domains. Regional wise, across EMEA and APAC, we are building momentum in the countries we operated in, such as U.K., Nordic, Southeast A bad debt provision one-timer in there? Are there operational cost efforts that you've been able to pull forward that you think are lasting?\\nRoni Giladi -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. For sure, we can do this. What we see, we started the year in Q1 of 2020 with 16.1% operational profit. We now see Q3 and Q4 at the level of 17% to 17.3%. So for sure some of the efficiency that we took we can continue for the next half of the year and going forward. And this is why we are passing the 17% operational margin. So the answer for your question is for sure yes.\\nBryan C. Bergin -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\\nOkay. The reason I asked is how should we be thinking about that longer term margin profile on the other side of COVID?\\nRoni Giladi -- Chief Financial Officer\\nI think going forward Sapiens need to continue the 17% plus. Obviously, sometimes we'll do M&A and we are pursuing M&A. So the question is what will be happening with the acquisition of any company. In particular, most of the companies that we acquired so far have lower gross margin than Sapiens. So initial few quarters are basically taking us a little bit down, but over time, and we improve it with all the acquisition that we did, we are being able to do -- to increase them to the level of Sapiens. The same will happen also with Delphi.\\nBryan C. Bergin -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\\nOkay. Thank you.\\nOperator\\nThe next question is from Omri Velvart from Legacy Value Partners. Please go ahead.\\nOmri Velvart -- Legacy Value Partners -- Analyst\\nHi. First of all, congratulations for another great quarter, really impressive. I would like to ask, in your January Investor Conference in Israel, you talked about the workers' compensation product and some major tenders coming in the U.S. I would like to know what's the current situation there with COVID? And other related aspects of this field? You've talked about as a really promising area of your business.\\nRoni Al-Dor -- President & Chief Executive Officer\\nOkay. First of all, good that you listen to all the events. So it's win that you are OK. And this is -- basically this area is really affecting the COVID all the workers' compensation business. So right now based on our information, the government is slowing down. And all the RFP that's planned to send to companies like us is still in process. Every quarter we are getting in the near future, we can get it and we are still waiting. Right now, we don't really believe that we will get in this quarter. Hopefully in the next quarter we will see few of them. But right now it's not -- we are not very optimistic how to get.\\nOmri Velvart -- Legacy Value Partners -- Analyst\\nOkay. Thank you. The next quarter is actually pretty good for me at least. Another question, please. What -- do you see any change in hiring trends and some human capital availability in this environment, after all, you are strong and a stable company, especially in Israel, but also in other key market of yours like U.S. and Europe, etc.?\\nRoni Al-Dor -- President & Chief Executive Officer\\nI can answer the first question in terms of hiring employee. This is better to Sapiens at this point. People -- a lot of start-up are not raising money, so the people are more open and more interesting to come to Sapiens, also because we are bringing a lot of innovation to our product is also help. So overall it's positive and also less people are living Sapiens like in the past, people are moved from one vendor to another. So right now, it's much more stable.\\nAnd again, but it's still for good people. It's difficult like -- but they're generally on the positive side. In terms of the capital...\\nRoni Giladi -- Chief Financial Officer\\nWhat is the question. Omri? The second one.\\nOmri Velvart -- Legacy Value Partners -- Analyst\\nHuman capital, human capital availability.\\nRoni Giladi -- Chief Financial Officer\\nJust to conclude on that, in Q2, we froze all the position that we had. And right now we are in recruiting mode. We have right now 200 open positions in the company that we are looking to recruit. And as Roni mentioned, in terms of hief Financial Officer\\nYes. All the factors that I mentioned in my prepared remarks are basically inputs in operational expenses and gross margin. For example, at the time of that we asked employees to use across the entire company, the freeze in recruiting, this is another factor was the gross margin up by 1% compared to previous quarter. Going forward further in Q3 and Q4, we do not expect all these things will happen. As I mentioned earlier, we are right now in recruiting mode. We have open position of almost 200 employees. To support our growth, we are not implementing any use of vacation days. So the gross margin will not be as it in Q2, but we expect that it will be probably in the mid-range, 45.5 something like that.\\nBhavan Suri -- William Blair -- Analyst\\nGot you. Thank you, guys. I appreciate it. Nice job.\\nRoni Al-Dor -- President & Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you.\\nOperator\\nThe next question is from Tavy Rosner of Barclays. Please go ahead.\\nTavy Rosner -- Barclays Capital -- Analyst\\nHi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on the strong results. Just following up on your last comment, Roni, on organic growth where you mentioned that you don't expect a pickup in the inorganic growth this year compared to your previous estimate. And I guess, just looking at the broader context of corona, I would have on the one hand expected more insurance companies to kind of turn to you guys for digitalization. On the other hand, I understand the marketing challenges given that you can't attend conferences and everything. So would you say looking hedge in the next 18 months that the pipeline is kind of growing kind of down the road?\\nRoni Al-Dor -- President & Chief Executive Officer\\nIt's a challenges question. In one hand, the insurance company really understand demand for digital, and this is the major thing for them. In the other hand, most of them believe that the [Indecipherable] cannot be the same as it was the past. They are seeing more competition. So all of them understand the demand. The other thing is everything around the insurtech in open -- enabled for them to open for them, it's also they need to open the technology. And the last thing is the expenses. So I think this is also something that Sapiens really helped to the insurance company to reduce long-term expenses. But right now I think that the people are now analyzed. Nobody really know for how long this COVID can be. So it's a time that people postponed their decisions. So it's difficult right now to give estimate for 18 months. Again, this is the situation that we are seeing right now and this is why we are taking conservative approach.\\nTavy Rosner -- Barclays Capital -- Analyst\\nI appreciate the color. Thank you.\\nRoni Al-Dor -- President & Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you.\\nOperator\\nThe next question is from Bryan Bergin of Cowen. Please go ahead.\\nBryan C. Bergin -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\\nHi guys. Thank you. I wanted to follow-up on deal closure. So obviously, I heard the commentary on slow transformational deal progression. But I'm curious if you did see any behavior change as 2Q progressed? And then if you've had anything incremental as far as willingness to sign in July? So really anything on the margin at least that you're seeing a potential improvement or is it really just been consistent throughout this period?\\nRoni Giladi -- Chief Financial Officer\\nHi, Bryan. This is Roni G. As Roni mentioned, obviously we see decline in pipeline because all of the factors that we mentioned earlier that we do not have opportunity to meet during conferences, marketing has moved to digital instead of face-to-face and people right now are in let's say some uncertainties or putting something in hold. All of that basically reduced the number of new deals that we are signing today, but we are still signing new deals. We did not see slowdown in July versus Q2.\\nBryan C. Bergin -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\\nOkay. And then just on the cost reduction. What efforts are sustainable versus those variable selling expenses and R&D that may come back and may have the  Prepared Remarks:\\nOperator\\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by.

What efforts are sustainable versus those variable selling expenses and R&D that may come back and may have the   early July, we announced a partnership with Quadient Inspire to help our customer drive efficiency by quickly designing, modifying, managing and delivery documents. In another example, Sapiens partners use cloud analytics to provide easy-to-use AI products for our workers' compensation customers. The current businesses disruption related to pandemic increased state of urgency of the insurance companies to migrate the legacy platform and create competitive advantage by offering more digital solution. While improving their operational efficiency, we see an industrywide trend in which COVID-19 is accelerating shift to digital platform with the cost efficiency and improving customer experience it brings.\\nThis by itself is driving future opportunity for Sapiens. Digital is a key enabling rapid response to the market dynamics, cost efficiency and regulatory change. And our digital offering enables customers to manage core business function, policy administration, claims and billing and support their digital transformation. Insurance payers that look for new digital platform appreciate the value of Sapiens as a strategic partner for their businesses. We believe that most carriers that started looking for a new system will continue as planned and selective vendor to launch their transformation or at least start with limited blueprint phases, yet some posters are taking longer to close their transformation projects.\\nFor the remainder of 2020, I'm pleased to say the deliverables to our existing customers remain on track with a minimal impact on our revenue stream. We continue to see growth in sales of recent customer, which proves the viability of our partnership of success business model. The customer success team is dedicated to expanding our relations with the existing clients and is doing an outstanding job promoting our enhanced digital offering to increase our wallet share.\\nWe continue to invest in both sales people and marketing resources to support this growing revenue stream. In parallel, we expect to continue and signed new project with a new customer that realize that digital transformation is the key to their businesses. The current environment has changed how we do business development and marketing. Our teams are more focused on developing remote client relation and digital marketing tools to address the restricted travel and the lack of face-to-face events. This effect has a short-term benefit of lowering costs related to travel and marketing. We have accelerated the online engagement model and we'll conduct our first virtual client conference in the fall. We have also been very active with webinars and remote user groups to replace face-to-face session.\\nBack to the M&A front, Sapiens has demonstrated its experience in this space with the successful acquisitions we have done to date. Over the past decade, we have completed more than dozen strategic acquisition to expand our platform capabilities and geographic presence. The acquisitions we made in the past few years in North America, and now more recently in Europe, provide this platform to our future organic growth. We have proven track record to seamlessly integrated acquired companies into one Sapiens, expanding our customer base and product portfolio, while merging into one efficient operational organization. This has allowed us to grow our value proposition, expand our operating margin and improve profitability over the past 10 years. We will continue to pursue additional M&A opportunities. I would like to use this opportunity to share with you that Sapiens was recently added to Tel Aviv 35 Index. The index tracks the price of 35 companies with highest market cap on Tel Aviv Exchange.\\nIn closing, I would like to say that Sapiens global team remains focused on executing our strategy since we expect new customer will be slow to close will put more focus to leverage the advantage of our large global client base and rich solution portfolios.

Are there operational cost efforts that you've been able to pull forward that you think are lasting?\\nRoni Giladi -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. For sure, we can do this. What we see, we started the year in Q1 of 2020 with 16.1% operational profit. We now see Q3 and Q4 at the level of 17% to 17.3%. So for sure some of the efficiency that we took we can continue for the next half of the year and going forward. And this is why we are passing the 17% operational margin. So the answer for your question is for sure yes.\\nBryan C. Bergin -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\\nOkay. The reason I asked is how should we be thinking about that longer term margin profile on the other side of COVID?\\nRoni Giladi -- Chief Financial Officer\\nI think going forward Sapiens need to continue the 17% plus. Obviously, sometimes we'll do M&A and we are pursuing M&A. So the question is what will be happening with the acquisition of any company. In particular, most of the companies that we acquired so far have lower gross margin than Sapiens. So initial few quarters are basically taking us a little bit down, but over time, and we improve it with all the acquisition that we did, we are being able to do -- to increase them to the level of Sapiens. The same will happen also with Delphi.\\nBryan C. Bergin -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\\nOkay. Thank you.\\nOperator\\nThe next question is from Omri Velvart from Legacy Value Partners. Please go ahead.\\nOmri Velvart -- Legacy Value Partners -- Analyst\\nHi. First of all, congratulations for another great quarter, really impressive. I would like to ask, in your January Investor Conference in Israel, you talked about the workers' compensation product and some major tenders coming in the U.S. I would like to know what's the current situation there with COVID? And other related aspects of this field? You've talked about as a really promising area of your business.\\nRoni Al-Dor -- President & Chief Executive Officer\\nOkay. First of all, good that you listen to all the events. So it's win that you are OK. And this is -- basically this area is really affecting the COVID all the workers' compensation business. So right now based on our information, the government is slowing down. And all the RFP that's planned to send to companies like us is still in process. Every quarter we are getting in the near future, we can get it and we are still waiting. Right now, we don't really believe that we will get in this quarter. Hopefully in the next quarter we will see few of them. But right now it's not -- we are not very optimistic how to get.\\nOmri Velvart -- Legacy Value Partners -- Analyst\\nOkay. Thank you. The next quarter is actually pretty good for me at least. Another question, please. What -- do you see any change in hiring trends and some human capital availability in this environment, after all, you are strong and a stable company, especially in Israel, but also in other key market of yours like U.S. and Europe, etc.?\\nRoni Al-Dor -- President & Chief Executive Officer\\nI can answer the first question in terms of hiring employee. This is better to Sapiens at this point. People -- a lot of start-up are not raising money, so the people are more open and more interesting to come to Sapiens, also because we are bringing a lot of innovation to our product is also help. So overall it's positive and also less people are living Sapiens like in the past, people are moved from one vendor to another. So right now, it's much more stable.\\nAnd again, but it's still for good people. It's difficult like -- but they're generally on the positive side. In terms of the capital...\\nRoni Giladi -- Chief Financial Officer\\nWhat is the question. Omri? The second one.\\nOmri Velvart -- Legacy Value Partners -- Analyst\\nHuman capital, human capital availability.\\nRoni Giladi -- Chief Financial Officer\\nJust to conclude on that, in Q2, we froze all the position that we had. And right now we are in recruiting mode. We have right now 200 open positions in the company that we are looking to recruit. And as Roni mentioned, in terms of n and total debt of $120 million spread over the next 5.5 years. To strengthen our balance sheet, in early June, we completed a public offering of $60 million non-convertible Series B debenture listed in Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. This raise is at the same time of the debenture we raised in September 2017, and together represents the total debt we have of $120 million. We completed this raise to strengthen our balance sheet and to provide capital for future M&A. During July, Maalot, part of Standard & Poor's Group, reaffirmed the Company Israel A+ stable rating. In the second quarter, we achieved $14.7 million in free cash flow. We continue to have high conversion from net profit to free cash flow.\\nIn closing, I would like to turn to our guidance for 2020. Our business model has shown its strength in Q2 during the first full quarter impacted by COVID-19 pandemic, and has shown our resilience in this challenging environment. We are benefiting from high repeatable business from existing customer with high stickiness and visibility, which allow us to continue to grow the company. We are increasing our revenue and profitability guidance.\\nOn the revenue side, we raised the bottom range by $8 million and the top range by $4 million, primarily due to recent Delphi acquisition. This bring our revenue guidance to a new range of $376 million to $381 million, reflecting an increase of the midpoint by 16.2% year-over-year, of which 8% is attributable to organic growth. Q2 operating margin jumped to 18%. However, some of the measures taken in Q2 will not continue in the second half of the year, such as the use of accrued vacation days. In addition, we have resumed recruiting employees globally to support our growth and our marketing activities have also resumed and pivoted to digital strategy.\\nBased on the above, our operating margin in the second half of the year for Sapiens without Delphi is in the range of 17% to 17.3%. Delphi, which we just acquired, will be consolidated in our reporting beginning of August 1. While Delphi will be positive impact on Sapiens' revenue, it is currently not profitable on a stand-alone basis. Based on the above, we are increasing our guidance for the full year consolidated profit to the range of 16.5% to 16.9% from the previous guidance of 16% to 16.5%. With regards to Delphi, we are entering a process to turn around its business performance in 2021 to Sapiens level of profitability.\\nTo summarize, we remain confident in our outlook for the remainder of 2020 with the following. Our ability to achieve revenue growth and expand margin. Our cash position of $128 million by the end of quarter, which will allow us to continue to pursue other M&A based on our strategy. And our ability to generate free cash flow quarter-over-quarter.\\nI would like now to turn the call back to Roni Al-Dor for closing comments. Roni?\\nRoni Al-Dor -- President & Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you, Roni. The customer success team is doing an outstanding job providing critical support to our customers globally.

All the factors that I mentioned in my prepared remarks are basically inputs in operational expenses and gross margin. For example, at the time of that we asked employees to use across the entire company, the freeze in recruiting, this is another factor was the gross margin up by 1% compared to previous quarter. Going forward further in Q3 and Q4, we do not expect all these things will happen. As I mentioned earlier, we are right now in recruiting mode. We have open position of almost 200 employees. To support our growth, we are not implementing any use of vacation days. So the gross margin will not be as it in Q2, but we expect that it will be probably in the mid-range, 45.5 something like that.\\nBhavan Suri -- William Blair -- Analyst\\nGot you. Thank you, guys. I appreciate it. Nice job.\\nRoni Al-Dor -- President & Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you.\\nOperator\\nThe next question is from Tavy Rosner of Barclays. Please go ahead.\\nTavy Rosner -- Barclays Capital -- Analyst\\nHi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on the strong results. Just following up on your last comment, Roni, on organic growth where you mentioned that you don't expect a pickup in the inorganic growth this year compared to your previous estimate. And I guess, just looking at the broader context of corona, I would have on the one hand expected more insurance companies to kind of turn to you guys for digitalization. On the other hand, I understand the marketing challenges given that you can't attend conferences and everything. So would you say looking hedge in the next 18 months that the pipeline is kind of growing kind of down the road?\\nRoni Al-Dor -- President & Chief Executive Officer\\nIt's a challenges question. In one hand, the insurance company really understand demand for digital, and this is the major thing for them. In the other hand, most of them believe that the [Indecipherable] cannot be the same as it was the past. They are seeing more competition. So all of them understand the demand. The other thing is everything around the insurtech in open -- enabled for them to open for them, it's also they need to open the technology. And the last thing is the expenses. So I think this is also something that Sapiens really helped to the insurance company to reduce long-term expenses. But right now I think that the people are now analyzed. Nobody really know for how long this COVID can be. So it's a time that people postponed their decisions. So it's difficult right now to give estimate for 18 months. Again, this is the situation that we are seeing right now and this is why we are taking conservative approach.\\nTavy Rosner -- Barclays Capital -- Analyst\\nI appreciate the color. Thank you.\\nRoni Al-Dor -- President & Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you.\\nOperator\\nThe next question is from Bryan Bergin of Cowen. Please go ahead.\\nBryan C. Bergin -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\\nHi guys. Thank you. I wanted to follow-up on deal closure. So obviously, I heard the commentary on slow transformational deal progression. But I'm curious if you did see any behavior change as 2Q progressed? And then if you've had anything incremental as far as willingness to sign in July? So really anything on the margin at least that you're seeing a potential improvement or is it really just been consistent throughout this period?\\nRoni Giladi -- Chief Financial Officer\\nHi, Bryan. This is Roni G. As Roni mentioned, obviously we see decline in pipeline because all of the factors that we mentioned earlier that we do not have opportunity to meet during conferences, marketing has moved to digital instead of face-to-face and people right now are in let's say some uncertainties or putting something in hold. All of that basically reduced the number of new deals that we are signing today, but we are still signing new deals. We did not see slowdown in July versus Q2.\\nBryan C. Bergin -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\\nOkay. And then just on the cost reduction. What efforts are sustainable versus those variable selling expenses and R&D that may come back and may have the  d signed new project with a new customer that realize that digital transformation is the key to their businesses. The current environment has changed how we do business development and marketing. Our teams are more focused on developing remote client relation and digital marketing tools to address the restricted travel and the lack of face-to-face events. This effect has a short-term benefit of lowering costs related to travel and marketing. We have accelerated the online engagement model and we'll conduct our first virtual client conference in the fall. We have also been very active with webinars and remote user groups to replace face-to-face session.\\nBack to the M&A front, Sapiens has demonstrated its experience in this space with the successful acquisitions we have done to date. Over the past decade, we have completed more than dozen strategic acquisition to expand our platform capabilities and geographic presence. The acquisitions we made in the past few years in North America, and now more recently in Europe, provide this platform to our future organic growth. We have proven track record to seamlessly integrated acquired companies into one Sapiens, expanding our customer base and product portfolio, while merging into one efficient operational organization. This has allowed us to grow our value proposition, expand our operating margin and improve profitability over the past 10 years. We will continue to pursue additional M&A opportunities. I would like to use this opportunity to share with you that Sapiens was recently added to Tel Aviv 35 Index. The index tracks the price of 35 companies with highest market cap on Tel Aviv Exchange.\\nIn closing, I would like to say that Sapiens global team remains focused on executing our strategy since we expect new customer will be slow to close will put more focus to leverage the advantage of our large global client base and rich solution portfolios. We will continue to invest in our core and digital offering and devote resource to product development to maintain our leadership position in the market. And we will continue to develop capabilities to meet the growing demand for our cloud and managed services offering. We are well positioned for continued growth in the long run.\\nI would now like to turn the call over to our CFO, Roni GIladi to provide more details on our financial results. Please go ahead, Roni.\\nRoni Giladi -- Chief Financial Officer\\nThank you, Roni. I will review the second quarter non-GAAP results, followed by comments on the balance sheet and cash flow and end with our guidance for the remainder of 2020. This quarter was the first full quarter impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. While we met our revenue guidance, we exceeded our profitability due to measures we took to reduce spending in reaction to the uncertainty of the pandemic.\\nWith regards to our workforce, we reduced our work with contractors and shifted to work in-house. We asked our worldwide employees, mainly on the corporate side, to use accrued vacation days. Industry marketing events and conferences were cancelled. And as a result, associated marketing expenses were reduced. Typically, as a global company, our teams are required to travel extensively. This quarter, due to work from home restriction, and in many cases quarantine requirements for travelers, we incurred low travel and accommodation expenses, efficiency measures that we took across all geography, division and department.\\nIn the second quarter, we froze recruiting. We remained at the same level of employees as of the end of Q1 of 2020, while shifting employees to growth area. All the above factors reduced our cost and improved our margin in the second quarter. I will provide further detail in my guidance comments concerning the impact on the rest of the year.\\nRevenue. Revenue in the second quarter of 2020 increased 17% to $93.1 million, up from $79.5 million in the second quarter of 2019. The organic revenue growth was 10%. In addition, the M&A contribution of our Calculo and sum.cumo acquisition was 8% and was offset by 1% due to currency i s everything around the insurtech in open -- enabled for them to open for them, it's also they need to open the technology. And the last thing is the expenses. So I think this is also something that Sapiens really helped to the insurance company to reduce long-term expenses. But right now I think that the people are now analyzed. Nobody really know for how long this COVID can be. So it's a time that people postponed their decisions. So it's difficult right now to give estimate for 18 months. Again, this is the situation that we are seeing right now and this is why we are taking conservative approach.\\nTavy Rosner -- Barclays Capital -- Analyst\\nI appreciate the color. Thank you.\\nRoni Al-Dor -- President & Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you.\\nOperator\\nThe next question is from Bryan Bergin of Cowen. Please go ahead.\\nBryan C. Bergin -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\\nHi guys. Thank you. I wanted to follow-up on deal closure. So obviously, I heard the commentary on slow transformational deal progression. But I'm curious if you did see any behavior change as 2Q progressed? And then if you've had anything incremental as far as willingness to sign in July? So really anything on the margin at least that you're seeing a potential improvement or is it really just been consistent throughout this period?\\nRoni Giladi -- Chief Financial Officer\\nHi, Bryan. This is Roni G. As Roni mentioned, obviously we see decline in pipeline because all of the factors that we mentioned earlier that we do not have opportunity to meet during conferences, marketing has moved to digital instead of face-to-face and people right now are in let's say some uncertainties or putting something in hold. All of that basically reduced the number of new deals that we are signing today, but we are still signing new deals. We did not see slowdown in July versus Q2.\\nBryan C. Bergin -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\\nOkay. And then just on the cost reduction. What efforts are sustainable versus those variable selling expenses and R&D that may come back and may have the bad debt provision one-timer in there? Are there operational cost efforts that you've been able to pull forward that you think are lasting?\\nRoni Giladi -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. For sure, we can do this. What we see, we started the year in Q1 of 2020 with 16.1% operational profit. We now see Q3 and Q4 at the level of 17% to 17.3%. So for sure some of the efficiency that we took we can continue for the next half of the year and going forward. And this is why we are passing the 17% operational margin. So the answer for your question is for sure yes.\\nBryan C. Bergin -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\\nOkay. The reason I asked is how should we be thinking about that longer term margin profile on the other side of COVID?\\nRoni Giladi -- Chief Financial Officer\\nI think going forward Sapiens need to continue the 17% plus. Obviously, sometimes we'll do M&A and we are pursuing M&A. So the question is what will be happening with the acquisition of any company. In particular, most of the companies that we acquired so far have lower gross margin than Sapiens. So initial few quarters are basically taking us a little bit down, but over time, and we improve it with all the acquisition that we did, we are being able to do -- to increase them to the level of Sapiens. The same will happen also with Delphi.\\nBryan C. Bergin -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\\nOkay. Thank you.\\nOperator\\nThe next question is from Omri Velvart from Legacy Value Partners. Please go ahead.\\nOmri Velvart -- Legacy Value Partners -- Analyst\\nHi. First of all, congratulations for another great quarter, really impressive. I would like to ask, in your January Investor Conference in Israel, you talked about the workers' compensation product and some major tenders coming in the U.S. I would like to know what's the current situation there with COVID? And other related aspects of this field? You've talked about as a really promising area of your business.\\nRoni Al-Dor -- President & Chief Executive Officer\\nOkay. First of all, good that you listen to all the events. So i n and total debt of $120 million spread over the next 5.5 years. To strengthen our balance sheet, in early June, we completed a public offering of $60 million non-convertible Series B debenture listed in Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. This raise is at the same time of the debenture we raised in September 2017, and together represents the total debt we have of $120 million. We completed this raise to strengthen our balance sheet and to provide capital for future M&A. During July, Maalot, part of Standard & Poor's Group, reaffirmed the Company Israel A+ stable rating. In the second quarter, we achieved $14.7 million in free cash flow. We continue to have high conversion from net profit to free cash flow.\\nIn closing, I would like to turn to our guidance for 2020. Our business model has shown its strength in Q2 during the first full quarter impacted by COVID-19 pandemic, and has shown our resilience in this challenging environment. We are benefiting from high repeatable business from existing customer with high stickiness and visibility, which allow us to continue to grow the company. We are increasing our revenue and profitability guidance.\\nOn the revenue side, we raised the bottom range by $8 million and the top range by $4 million, primarily due to recent Delphi acquisition. This bring our revenue guidance to a new range of $376 million to $381 million, reflecting an increase of the midpoint by 16.2% year-over-year, of which 8% is attributable to organic growth. Q2 operating margin jumped to 18%. However, some of the measures taken in Q2 will not continue in the second half of the year, such as the use of accrued vacation days. In addition, we have resumed recruiting employees globally to support our growth and our marketing activities have also resumed and pivoted to digital strategy.\\nBased on the above, our operating margin in the second half of the year for Sapiens without Delphi is in the range of 17% to 17.3%. Delphi, which we just acquired, will be consolidated in our reporting beginning of August 1. While Delphi will be positive impact on Sapiens' revenue, it is currently not profitable on a stand-alone basis. Based on the above, we are increasing our guidance for the full year consolidated profit to the range of 16.5% to 16.9% from the previous guidance of 16% to 16.5%. With regards to Delphi, we are entering a process to turn around its business performance in 2021 to Sapiens level of profitability.\\nTo summarize, we remain confident in our outlook for the remainder of 2020 with the following. Our ability to achieve revenue growth and expand margin. Our cash position of $128 million by the end of quarter, which will allow us to continue to pursue other M&A based on our strategy. And our ability to generate free cash flow quarter-over-quarter.\\nI would like now to turn the call back to Roni Al-Dor for closing comments. Roni?\\nRoni Al-Dor -- President & Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you, Roni. The customer success team is doing an outstanding job providing critical support to our customers globally. Sapiens global sales team continued to focus on signing new businesses in these challenging market conditions. Our leadership team remain focused on delivering growth and margin expansion as we execute against our long-term objective of improving shareholder value. Sapiens is well positioned for success and growth.\\nI would like now to close our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator?\\nQuestions and Answers:\\nOperator\\nThank you.

Nice job there. I want to just first, Roni Al-Dor, review, you've mentioned majority of implementation work has continued through COVID, I just want to touch on the new deal perspective. You touched a little bit where you had some delays, I'd love to understand what you're seeing in the pipeline? How does the pipeline look? And are you seeing elongation of sales cycles or if some deals don't happen? sia and South Africa.\\nIn addition, we start to expand the footprint in that in DACH and Iberia region, following sum.cumo and Calculo acquisitions. We continue to integrate these entities into one Sapiens and have seen improvement in their operational performance. Both sum.cumo and Calculo are well established in their local markets and we are investing in growing the sales and marketing in these two regions. The market is positive accepting Sapiens global presence and comprehensive product offering that is now supported by local professional team.\\nIn North America, we are growing our market and wallet share and increasing awareness for our P&C offering as well as getting traction with our Life and Annuities products. Sapiens' Policy Pro for P&C, the core components of our CoreSuite for P&C North America was recognized by Celent as one of the top five vendors in the U.S. market. Thanks to the rich functionality and advanced technology, our U.S. team is doing great job lending and expanding our businesses and moving up market.\\nOur investment in R&D help us maintain the leadership position of our product portfolio. In the second quarter, we made upgrades to a key component in our product offering. For example, our Life CoreSuite new release is using cloud-native architecture. It includes reconfigure products and processes that accelerate new insurance product launches. New version of our cloud-based digital suites for both P&C and Life and Annuities. And we have released a new version of our cloud-based insurance underwriting solution with a new insurance interface.\\nIn terms of service [Technical Issue] we see an increased demand for managed services across all of our products and regions. Our managed services offerings brought tremendous value to our customer during the COVID-19. These platforms allowed customers to focus on their businesses, while we take care of the technology operational part. We continue to expand our ecosystem to support our customers with the latest insurtech and digital [Technical Issue]\\nIn early July, we announced a partnership with Quadient Inspire to help our customer drive efficiency by quickly designing, modifying, managing and delivery documents. In another example, Sapiens partners use cloud analytics to provide easy-to-use AI products for our workers' compensation customers. The current businesses disruption related to pandemic increased state of urgency of the insurance companies to migrate the legacy platform and create competitive advantage by offering more digital solution. While improving their operational efficiency, we see an industrywide trend in which COVID-19 is accelerating shift to digital platform with the cost efficiency and improving customer experience it brings.\\nThis by itself is driving future opportunity for Sapiens. Digital is a key enabling rapid response to the market dynamics, cost efficiency and regulatory change. And our digital offering enables customers to manage core business function, policy administration, claims and billing and support their digital transformation. Insurance payers that look for new digital platform appreciate the value of Sapiens as a strategic partner for their businesses. We believe that most carriers that started looking for a new system will continue as planned and selective vendor to launch their transformation or at least start with limited blueprint phases, yet some posters are taking longer to close their transformation projects.\\nFor the remainder of 2020, I'm pleased to say the deliverables to our existing customers remain on track with a minimal impact on our revenue stream. We continue to see growth in sales of recent customer, which proves the viability of our partnership of success business model. The customer success team is dedicated to expanding our relations with the existing clients and is doing an outstanding job promoting our enhanced digital offering to increase our wallet share.\\nWe continue to invest in both sales people and marketing resources to support this growing revenue stream. In parallel, we expect to continue an s everything around the insurtech in open -- enabled for them to open for them, it's also they need to open the technology. And the last thing is the expenses. So I think this is also something that Sapiens really helped to the insurance company to reduce long-term expenses. But right now I think that the people are now analyzed. Nobody really know for how long this COVID can be. So it's a time that people postponed their decisions. So it's difficult right now to give estimate for 18 months. Again, this is the situation that we are seeing right now and this is why we are taking conservative approach.\\nTavy Rosner -- Barclays Capital -- Analyst\\nI appreciate the color. Thank you.\\nRoni Al-Dor -- President & Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you.\\nOperator\\nThe next question is from Bryan Bergin of Cowen. Please go ahead.\\nBryan C. Bergin -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\\nHi guys. Thank you. I wanted to follow-up on deal closure. So obviously, I heard the commentary on slow transformational deal progression. But I'm curious if you did see any behavior change as 2Q progressed? And then if you've had anything incremental as far as willingness to sign in July? So really anything on the margin at least that you're seeing a potential improvement or is it really just been consistent throughout this period?\\nRoni Giladi -- Chief Financial Officer\\nHi, Bryan. This is Roni G. As Roni mentioned, obviously we see decline in pipeline because all of the factors that we mentioned earlier that we do not have opportunity to meet during conferences, marketing has moved to digital instead of face-to-face and people right now are in let's say some uncertainties or putting something in hold. All of that basically reduced the number of new deals that we are signing today, but we are still signing new deals. We did not see slowdown in July versus Q2.\\nBryan C. Bergin -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\\nOkay. And then just on the cost reduction. What efforts are sustainable versus those variable selling expenses and R&D that may come back and may have the bad debt provision one-timer in there? Are there operational cost efforts that you've been able to pull forward that you think are lasting?\\nRoni Giladi -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. For sure, we can do this. What we see, we started the year in Q1 of 2020 with 16.1% operational profit. We now see Q3 and Q4 at the level of 17% to 17.3%. So for sure some of the efficiency that we took we can continue for the next half of the year and going forward. And this is why we are passing the 17% operational margin. So the answer for your question is for sure yes.\\nBryan C. Bergin -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\\nOkay. The reason I asked is how should we be thinking about that longer term margin profile on the other side of COVID?\\nRoni Giladi -- Chief Financial Officer\\nI think going forward Sapiens need to continue the 17% plus. Obviously, sometimes we'll do M&A and we are pursuing M&A. So the question is what will be happening with the acquisition of any company. In particular, most of the companies that we acquired so far have lower gross margin than Sapiens. So initial few quarters are basically taking us a little bit down, but over time, and we improve it with all the acquisition that we did, we are being able to do -- to increase them to the level of Sapiens. The same will happen also with Delphi.\\nBryan C. Bergin -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\\nOkay. Thank you.\\nOperator\\nThe next question is from Omri Velvart from Legacy Value Partners. Please go ahead.\\nOmri Velvart -- Legacy Value Partners -- Analyst\\nHi. First of all, congratulations for another great quarter, really impressive. I would like to ask, in your January Investor Conference in Israel, you talked about the workers' compensation product and some major tenders coming in the U.S. I would like to know what's the current situation there with COVID? And other related aspects of this field? You've talked about as a really promising area of your business.\\nRoni Al-Dor -- President & Chief Executive Officer\\nOkay. First of all, good that you listen to all the events. So i s everything around the insurtech in open -- enabled for them to open for them, it's also they need to open the technology. And the last thing is the expenses. So I think this is also something that Sapiens really helped to the insurance company to reduce long-term expenses. But right now I think that the people are now analyzed. Nobody really know for how long this COVID can be. So it's a time that people postponed their decisions.

I would like to ask, in your January Investor Conference in Israel, you talked about the workers' compensation product and some major tenders coming in the U.S. I would like to know what's the current situation there with COVID? And other related aspects of this field? You've talked about as a really promising area of your business.\\nRoni Al-Dor -- President & Chief Executive Officer\\nOkay. First of all, good that you listen to all the events. So i is that Delphi is very good if the insurance is focusing on med mal. If the insurance start to ask any other line of business, what we call multi-line, Delphi has a lot of challenges. And this is why we start to win deals, [Indecipherable] start to win deals and the One Shield. We don't really see a lot of Guidewire in this area.\\nSo those are the main competitors. We also won few deals in the past. Right now because we have -- already have med mal customer together with all the knowledge and the knowhow for Delphi, the combination of two of them, we definitely will continue to lead this market. We have close to 40 customers, it's many and a lot of knowledge and for many, many years, a very good track record. The main challenge was the technology and to support the multi-line.\\nBhavan Suri -- William Blair -- Analyst\\nGot it. Got it. And then maybe one last one. Obviously the rev raise for the full year is less than even half of Delphi's revenue. And so just help me understand sort of the conservative future building into the core business, the organic part of the business? Sort of how you're guys thinking about that growth? And sort of -- kind of are you expecting that there are some challenges or slowdown of business or is it just [Indecipherable] Just trying to understand sort of what you've built in there for the full year given that the raise with sort of Delphi's rev norm?\\nRoni Giladi -- Chief Financial Officer\\nHi, Bhavan. This is Roni G. So if you remember, by the end of Q1 of 2020, we reduced our guidance by 2%. The acquisition of Delphi is on a full year basis supposed to be about $6 million. So the increase in the revenue is mainly coming from Delphi. We do not expect right now organically to grow Sapiens stand-alone basis. So the incremental is coming only from Delphi on this revenue.\\nBhavan Suri -- William Blair -- Analyst\\nGot it. Got it. If I might squeeze one last one, I'm sorry. What drove the upside in gross margin? Like what -- how does your gross margin [Indecipherable]? Thank you.\\nRoni Giladi -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. All the factors that I mentioned in my prepared remarks are basically inputs in operational expenses and gross margin. For example, at the time of that we asked employees to use across the entire company, the freeze in recruiting, this is another factor was the gross margin up by 1% compared to previous quarter. Going forward further in Q3 and Q4, we do not expect all these things will happen. As I mentioned earlier, we are right now in recruiting mode. We have open position of almost 200 employees. To support our growth, we are not implementing any use of vacation days. So the gross margin will not be as it in Q2, but we expect that it will be probably in the mid-range, 45.5 something like that.\\nBhavan Suri -- William Blair -- Analyst\\nGot you. Thank you, guys. I appreciate it. Nice job.\\nRoni Al-Dor -- President & Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you.\\nOperator\\nThe next question is from Tavy Rosner of Barclays. Please go ahead.\\nTavy Rosner -- Barclays Capital -- Analyst\\nHi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on the strong results. Just following up on your last comment, Roni, on organic growth where you mentioned that you don't expect a pickup in the inorganic growth this year compared to your previous estimate. And I guess, just looking at the broader context of corona, I would have on the one hand expected more insurance companies to kind of turn to you guys for digitalization. On the other hand, I understand the marketing challenges given that you can't attend conferences and everything. So would you say looking hedge in the next 18 months that the pipeline is kind of growing kind of down the road?\\nRoni Al-Dor -- President & Chief Executive Officer\\nIt's a challenges question. In one hand, the insurance company really understand demand for digital, and this is the major thing for them. In the other hand, most of them believe that the [Indecipherable] cannot be the same as it was the past. They are seeing more competition. So all of them understand the demand. The other thing i sia and South Africa.\\nIn addition, we start to expand the footprint in that in DACH and Iberia region, following sum.cumo and Calculo acquisitions.

[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Bhavan Suri from William Blair. Please go ahead.\\nBhavan Suri -- William Blair -- Analyst\\nGood morning, guys. Afternoon, your time. Congrats. Nice job there. I want to just first, Roni Al-Dor, review, you've mentioned majority of implementation work has continued through COVID, I just want to touch on the new deal perspective. You touched a little bit where you had some delays, I'd love to understand what you're seeing in the pipeline? How does the pipeline look? And are you seeing elongation of sales cycles or if some deals don't happen? Love [Phonetic] to get a sense of how the new deal and the new logo wins are going?\\nRoni Al-Dor -- President & Chief Executive Officer\\nHi, Bhavan. Good morning for you. In terms of new business, we have several challenges. The first challenge is to get the lead. As you know, we are -- the way that we are getting lead is we see a lot of marketing events, conferencing the insurance analysts and any kind of digital events. Right now, a lot of them are not working for us. So we are still getting leads through the analysts, most of them highly respect what we are bringing and from a regular marketing. So that's point number one. The second challenge is the personal relationship and the confidence to give to those customers. That's also kind of challenge. And the third one is to really close the deals. So those are the challenges.\\nWhat we are -- first of all, we are working on all of those challenges to see how we are moving the investment to other type marketing events, other type of relationship and so on. There is still challenges. But as we mentioned, we are continuing to closing deals and also build the pipeline. I think the advantage that we have in few of our competitors is the size of Sapiens. That's also in this time insurance are preferred to working with the big company like Sapiens. We have outstanding reference. And we are -- we know how to work remotely. So the long answer for your question is there is still challenges, but we are -- we see some -- we see positive.\\nBhavan Suri -- William Blair -- Analyst\\nGot it. Got it. That's helpful.

Is there any difference?\\nRoni Al-Dor -- President & Chief Executive Officer\\nDelphi is definitely the market leader in U.S. for this.

So that's point number one. The second challenge is the personal relationship and the confidence to give to those customers. That's also kind of challenge. And the third one is to really close the deals. So those are the challenges.\\nWhat we are -- first of all, we are working on all of those challenges to see how we are moving the investment to other type marketing events, other type of relationship and so on. There is still challenges. But as we mentioned, we are continuing to closing deals and also build the pipeline. I think the advantage that we have in few of our competitors is the size of Sapiens. That's also in this time insurance are preferred to working with the big company like Sapiens. We have outstanding reference. And we are -- we know how to work remotely. So the long answer for your question is there is still challenges, but we are -- we see some -- we see positive.\\nBhavan Suri -- William Blair -- Analyst\\nGot it. Got it. That's helpful. I guess, I want to touch a little bit on Delphi in a second. Just when we look at that in the medical professional liability market, the malpractice market, just a sense of what the market opportunity looks like there? And who the competitors are? Is there any difference?\\nRoni Al-Dor -- President & Chief Executive Officer\\nDelphi is definitely the market leader in U.S. for this. The Delphi challenges was that for many, many years they lead this business. The main challenge  sia and South Africa.\\nIn addition, we start to expand the footprint in that in DACH and Iberia region, following sum.cumo and Calculo acquisitions. We continue to integrate these entities into one Sapiens and have seen improvement in their operational performance. Both sum.cumo and Calculo are well established in their local markets and we are investing in growing the sales and marketing in these two regions. The market is positive accepting Sapiens global presence and comprehensive product offering that is now supported by local professional team.\\nIn North America, we are growing our market and wallet share and increasing awareness for our P&C offering as well as getting traction with our Life and Annuities products. Sapiens' Policy Pro for P&C, the core components of our CoreSuite for P&C North America was recognized by Celent as one of the top five vendors in the U.S. market. Thanks to the rich functionality and advanced technology, our U.S. team is doing great job lending and expanding our businesses and moving up market.\\nOur investment in R&D help us maintain the leadership position of our product portfolio. In the second quarter, we made upgrades to a key component in our product offering. For example, our Life CoreSuite new release is using cloud-native architecture. It includes reconfigure products and processes that accelerate new insurance product launches. New version of our cloud-based digital suites for both P&C and Life and Annuities. And we have released a new version of our cloud-based insurance underwriting solution with a new insurance interface.\\nIn terms of service [Technical Issue] we see an increased demand for managed services across all of our products and regions. Our managed services offerings brought tremendous value to our customer during the COVID-19. These platforms allowed customers to focus on their businesses, while we take care of the technology operational part. We continue to expand our ecosystem to support our customers with the latest insurtech and digital [Technical Issue]\\nIn early July, we announced a partnership with Quadient Inspire to help our customer drive efficiency by quickly designing, modifying, managing and delivery documents. In another example, Sapiens partners use cloud analytics to provide easy-to-use AI products for our workers' compensation customers. The current businesses disruption related to pandemic increased state of urgency of the insurance companies to migrate the legacy platform and create competitive advantage by offering more digital solution. While improving their operational efficiency, we see an industrywide trend in which COVID-19 is accelerating shift to digital platform with the cost efficiency and improving customer experience it brings.\\nThis by itself is driving future opportunity for Sapiens. Digital is a key enabling rapid response to the market dynamics, cost efficiency and regulatory change. And our digital offering enables customers to manage core business function, policy administration, claims and billing and support their digital transformation. Insurance payers that look for new digital platform appreciate the value of Sapiens as a strategic partner for their businesses. We believe that most carriers that started looking for a new system will continue as planned and selective vendor to launch their transformation or at least start with limited blueprint phases, yet some posters are taking longer to close their transformation projects.\\nFor the remainder of 2020, I'm pleased to say the deliverables to our existing customers remain on track with a minimal impact on our revenue stream. We continue to see growth in sales of recent customer, which proves the viability of our partnership of success business model. The customer success team is dedicated to expanding our relations with the existing clients and is doing an outstanding job promoting our enhanced digital offering to increase our wallet share.\\nWe continue to invest in both sales people and marketing resources to support this growing revenue stream. In parallel, we expect to continue an rship position in the market. And we will continue to develop capabilities to meet the growing demand for our cloud and managed services offering. We are well positioned for continued growth in the long run.\\nI would now like to turn the call over to our CFO, Roni GIladi to provide more details on our financial results. Please go ahead, Roni.\\nRoni Giladi -- Chief Financial Officer\\nThank you, Roni. I will review the second quarter non-GAAP results, followed by comments on the balance sheet and cash flow and end with our guidance for the remainder of 2020. This quarter was the first full quarter impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. While we met our revenue guidance, we exceeded our profitability due to measures we took to reduce spending in reaction to the uncertainty of the pandemic.\\nWith regards to our workforce, we reduced our work with contractors and shifted to work in-house. We asked our worldwide employees, mainly on the corporate side, to use accrued vacation days. Industry marketing events and conferences were cancelled. And as a result, associated marketing expenses were reduced. Typically, as a global company, our teams are required to travel extensively. This quarter, due to work from home restriction, and in many cases quarantine requirements for travelers, we incurred low travel and accommodation expenses, efficiency measures that we took across all geography, division and department.\\nIn the second quarter, we froze recruiting. We remained at the same level of employees as of the end of Q1 of 2020, while shifting employees to growth area. All the above factors reduced our cost and improved our margin in the second quarter. I will provide further detail in my guidance comments concerning the impact on the rest of the year.\\nRevenue. Revenue in the second quarter of 2020 increased 17% to $93.1 million, up from $79.5 million in the second quarter of 2019. The organic revenue growth was 10%. In addition, the M&A contribution of our Calculo and sum.cumo acquisition was 8% and was offset by 1% due to currency impact. Our revenue in North America totaled $46.6 million, an increase of 19% compared to last year, mainly due to strong growth in P&C. Europe revenue totaled $41 million, a 21% increase compared to last year, mainly due to acquisition in the region. Revenue from North America and Europe combined represented 94% of our business.\\nGross profit gross profit. Gross profit this quarter totaled $41.9 million compared to $34.8 million in the second quarter of last year, an increase of 20%. Our gross margin this quarter increased 120 basis points to 45% from 43.8% in the second quarter of last year. In addition, gross margin increased by 100 basis points from Q1 of 2020. Operational expenses, R&D and SG&A, including the attribution of Calculo and sum.cumo, increased from $22.2 million to $25.1 million and remained at the same level of Q1 of 2020. Our SG&A costs grew mainly due to an increase of provision for doubtful accounts due to the uncertainty in the market.\\nMoving to operational profit. Operating profit totaled $16.8 million this quarter compared to $12.6 million in Q2 of 2019 and $14.6 million in the prior quarter. Our operating margin increased in the second quarter to 18%, a 220 basis points improvement from Q2 of 2019 and 190 basis points from Q1 of 2020. If we analyze our improvement from the prior quarter, we see that while we were able to grow our revenue by 2.8% in this quarter, our cost base only grew by 0.5%.\\nInterest expenses in Q2 were $63,000. This quarter we had $0.8 million interest expenses related to our debt, while we have $0.8 million income related to aging [Phonetic] transaction. We expect to have quarterly cost of approximately $1.2 million related to debenture in Q3 and Q4 of 2020. Net income attributable to Sapiens' shareholders for the quarter was $13.3 million compared to $9.5 million in the second quarter of last year, reflecting 40% growth. Diluted EPS increased to $0.26 from $0.19 of last year.\\nTurning to our balance sheet. As of June 30, we had cash and cash equivalents of $128 millio  Love [Phonetic] to get a sense of how the new deal and the new logo wins are going?\\nRoni Al-Dor -- President & Chief Executive Officer\\nHi, Bhavan. Good morning for you. In terms of new business, we have several challenges. The first challenge is to get the lead. As you know, we are -- the way that we are getting lead is we see a lot of marketing events, conferencing the insurance analysts and any kind of digital events. Right now, a lot of them are not working for us. So we are still getting leads through the analysts, most of them highly respect what we are bringing and from a regular marketing.

Is there any difference?\\nRoni Al-Dor -- President & Chief Executive Officer\\nDelphi is definitely the market leader in U.S. for this. The Delphi challenges was that for many, many years they lead this business. The main challenge is that Delphi is very good if the insurance is focusing on med mal. If the insurance start to ask any other line of business, what we call multi-line, Delphi has a lot of challenges. And this is why we start to win deals, [Indecipherable] start to win deals and the One Shield. We don't really see a lot of Guidewire in this area.\\nSo those are the main competitors. We also won few deals in the past. Right now because we have -- already have med mal customer together with all the knowledge and the knowhow for Delphi, the combination of two of them, we definitely will continue to lead this market. We have close to 40 customers, it's many and a lot of knowledge and for many, many years, a very good track record. The main challenge was the technology and to support the multi-line.\\nBhavan Suri -- William Blair -- Analyst\\nGot it. Got it. And then maybe one last one. Obviously the rev raise for the full year is less than even half of Delphi's revenue. And so just help me understand sort of the conservative future building into the core business, the organic part of the business? Sort of how you're guys thinking about that growth? And sort of -- kind of are you expecting that there are some challenges or slowdown of business or is it just [Indecipherable] Just trying to understand sort of what you've built in there for the full year given that the raise with sort of Delphi's rev norm?\\nRoni Giladi -- Chief Financial Officer\\nHi, Bhavan. This is Roni G. So if you remember, by the end of Q1 of 2020, we reduced our guidance by 2%. The acquisition of Delphi is on a full year basis supposed to be about $6 million. So the increase in the revenue is mainly coming from Delphi. We do not expect right now organically to grow Sapiens stand-alone basis. So the incremental is coming only from Delphi on this revenue.\\nBhavan Suri -- William Blair -- Analyst\\nGot it. Got it. If I might squeeze one last one, I'm sorry.

All the factors that I mentioned in my prepared remarks are basically inputs in operational expenses and gross margin. For example, at the time of that we asked employees to use across the entire company, the freeze in recruiting, this is another factor was the gross margin up by 1% compared to previous quarter. Going forward further in Q3 and Q4, we do not expect all these things will happen. As I mentioned earlier, we are right now in recruiting mode. We have open position of almost 200 employees. To support our growth, we are not implementing any use of vacation days. So the gross margin will not be as it in Q2, but we expect that it will be probably in the mid-range, 45.5 something like that.\\nBhavan Suri -- William Blair -- Analyst\\nGot you. Thank you, guys.

And I guess, just looking at the broader context of corona, I would have on the one hand expected more insurance companies to kind of turn to you guys for digitalization. On the other hand, I understand the marketing challenges given that you can't attend conferences and everything. So would you say looking hedge in the next 18 months that the pipeline is kind of growing kind of down the road?\\nRoni Al-Dor -- President & Chief Executive Officer\\nIt's a challenges question. In one hand, the insurance company really understand demand for digital, and this is the major thing for them. In the other hand, most of them believe that the [Indecipherable] cannot be the same as it was the past. They are seeing more competition. So all of them understand the demand. The other thing i n and total debt of $120 million spread over the next 5.5 years. To strengthen our balance sheet, in early June, we completed a public offering of $60 million non-convertible Series B debenture listed in Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. This raise is at the same time of the debenture we raised in September 2017, and together represents the total debt we have of $120 million. We completed this raise to strengthen our balance sheet and to provide capital for future M&A. During July, Maalot, part of Standard & Poor's Group, reaffirmed the Company Israel A+ stable rating. In the second quarter, we achieved $14.7 million in free cash flow. We continue to have high conversion from net profit to free cash flow.\\nIn closing, I would like to turn to our guidance for 2020. Our business model has shown its strength in Q2 during the first full quarter impacted by COVID-19 pandemic, and has shown our resilience in this challenging environment. We are benefiting from high repeatable business from existing customer with high stickiness and visibility, which allow us to continue to grow the company. We are increasing our revenue and profitability guidance.\\nOn the revenue side, we raised the bottom range by $8 million and the top range by $4 million, primarily due to recent Delphi acquisition. This bring our revenue guidance to a new range of $376 million to $381 million, reflecting an increase of the midpoint by 16.2% year-over-year, of which 8% is attributable to organic growth. Q2 operating margin jumped to 18%. However, some of the measures taken in Q2 will not continue in the second half of the year, such as the use of accrued vacation days. In addition, we have resumed recruiting employees globally to support our growth and our marketing activities have also resumed and pivoted to digital strategy.\\nBased on the above, our operating margin in the second half of the year for Sapiens without Delphi is in the range of 17% to 17.3%. Delphi, which we just acquired, will be consolidated in our reporting beginning of August 1. While Delphi will be positive impact on Sapiens' revenue, it is currently not profitable on a stand-alone basis. Based on the above, we are increasing our guidance for the full year consolidated profit to the range of 16.5% to 16.9% from the previous guidance of 16% to 16.5%. With regards to Delphi, we are entering a process to turn around its business performance in 2021 to Sapiens level of profitability.\\nTo summarize, we remain confident in our outlook for the remainder of 2020 with the following. Our ability to achieve revenue growth and expand margin. Our cash position of $128 million by the end of quarter, which will allow us to continue to pursue other M&A based on our strategy. And our ability to generate free cash flow quarter-over-quarter.\\nI would like now to turn the call back to Roni Al-Dor for closing comments. Roni?\\nRoni Al-Dor -- President & Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you, Roni. The customer success team is doing an outstanding job providing critical support to our customers globally. Sapiens global sales team continued to focus on signing new businesses in these challenging market conditions. Our leadership team remain focused on delivering growth and margin expansion as we execute against our long-term objective of improving shareholder value. Sapiens is well positioned for success and growth.\\nI would like now to close our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator?\\nQuestions and Answers:\\nOperator\\nThank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Bhavan Suri from William Blair. Please go ahead.\\nBhavan Suri -- William Blair -- Analyst\\nGood morning, guys. Afternoon, your time. Congrats. Nice job there. I want to just first, Roni Al-Dor, review, you've mentioned majority of implementation work has continued through COVID, I just want to touch on the new deal perspective. You touched a little bit where you had some delays, I'd love to understand what you're seeing in the pipeline? How does the pipeline look? And are you seeing elongation of sales cycles or if some deals don't happen? d signed new project with a new customer that realize that digital transformation is the key to their businesses. The current environment has changed how we do business development and marketing. Our teams are more focused on developing remote client relation and digital marketing tools to address the restricted travel and the lack of face-to-face events. This effect has a short-term benefit of lowering costs related to travel and marketing. We have accelerated the online engagement model and we'll conduct our first virtual client conference in the fall. We have also been very active with webinars and remote user groups to replace face-to-face session.\\nBack to the M&A front, Sapiens has demonstrated its experience in this space with the successful acquisitions we have done to date. Over the past decade, we have completed more than dozen strategic acquisition to expand our platform capabilities and geographic presence. The acquisitions we made in the past few years in North America, and now more recently in Europe, provide this platform to our future organic growth. We have proven track record to seamlessly integrated acquired companies into one Sapiens, expanding our customer base and product portfolio, while merging into one efficient operational organization. This has allowed us to grow our value proposition, expand our operating margin and improve profitability over the past 10 years. We will continue to pursue additional M&A opportunities. I would like to use this opportunity to share with you that Sapiens was recently added to Tel Aviv 35 Index. The index tracks the price of 35 companies with highest market cap on Tel Aviv Exchange.\\nIn closing, I would like to say that Sapiens global team remains focused on executing our strategy since we expect new customer will be slow to close will put more focus to leverage the advantage of our large global client base and rich solution portfolios. We will continue to invest in our core and digital offering and devote resource to product development to maintain our leadership position in the market. And we will continue to develop capabilities to meet the growing demand for our cloud and managed services offering. We are well positioned for continued growth in the long run.\\nI would now like to turn the call over to our CFO, Roni GIladi to provide more details on our financial results. Please go ahead, Roni.\\nRoni Giladi -- Chief Financial Officer\\nThank you, Roni. I will review the second quarter non-GAAP results, followed by comments on the balance sheet and cash flow and end with our guidance for the remainder of 2020. This quarter was the first full quarter impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. While we met our revenue guidance, we exceeded our profitability due to measures we took to reduce spending in reaction to the uncertainty of the pandemic.\\nWith regards to our workforce, we reduced our work with contractors and shifted to work in-house. We asked our worldwide employees, mainly on the corporate side, to use accrued vacation days. Industry marketing events and conferences were cancelled. And as a result, associated marketing expenses were reduced. Typically, as a global company, our teams are required to travel extensively. This quarter, due to work from home restriction, and in many cases quarantine requirements for travelers, we incurred low travel and accommodation expenses, efficiency measures that we took across all geography, division and department.\\nIn the second quarter, we froze recruiting. We remained at the same level of employees as of the end of Q1 of 2020, while shifting employees to growth area. All the above factors reduced our cost and improved our margin in the second quarter. I will provide further detail in my guidance comments concerning the impact on the rest of the year.\\nRevenue. Revenue in the second quarter of 2020 increased 17% to $93.1 million, up from $79.5 million in the second quarter of 2019. The organic revenue growth was 10%. In addition, the M&A contribution of our Calculo and sum.cumo acquisition was 8% and was offset by 1% due to currency i driven by growth in North America and EMEA. Last week, we announced the acquisition of Delphi Technology, a leading P&C solution vendor focused on MPL, the medical malpractice markets in North America. Sapiens will support Delphi customer end products, offer additional products and services to their customers and leverage Delphi's knowhow to enhance our P&C CoreSuite to provide holistic multi-line solution for MPL market. We paid $19.5 million for Delphi who had $50 million in revenue in 2019 with an operational loss. Like with our prior acquisition, we plan to integrate Delphi operation with our anticipated acquisition to be accretive in 2021.\\nThe second quarter was productive, thanks to the global Sapiens team effort who delivered new wins go live and upsell in the quarter. FBAlliance Insurance, a Farm Bureau Insurance protection provider select Sapiens for its core P&C platform and advanced analytics to accelerate growth and meet demand for rapid launch of new insurance product. Great Bay Insurance, a New Jersey based homeowner insurance, select Sapiens for cloud-based information for insurance and financial management. Sapiens solution will allow Great Bay to better manage their accounting, finance and reporting system. Implementation of solution is already under way.\\nSince the beginning of 2020, we experienced a growing traction with our DECISION platform in the insurance market. Following the proven track record we still won banks, now we see a growing interest from insurers using this platform for multiple used cases. Two of our new customers publicly shared the adoption of Sapiens DECISION platform. American family insurers will utilize our DECISION platform across various operation companies to create operational efficiency and improving operations. Home Point Financial will be using DECISION to leverage existing technology with the common language between business and domains. Regional wise, across EMEA and APAC, we are building momentum in the countries we operated in, such as U.K., Nordic, Southeast Asia and South Africa.\\nIn addition, we start to expand the footprint in that in DACH and Iberia region, following sum.cumo and Calculo acquisitions. We continue to integrate these entities into one Sapiens and have seen improvement in their operational performance. Both sum.cumo and Calculo are well established in their local markets and we are investing in growing the sales and marketing in these two regions. The market is positive accepting Sapiens global presence and comprehensive product offering that is now supported by local professional team.\\nIn North America, we are growing our market and wallet share and increasing awareness for our P&C offering as well as getting traction with our Life and Annuities products. Sapiens' Policy Pro for P&C, the core components of our CoreSuite for P&C North America was recognized by Celent as one of the top five vendors in the U.S. market. Thanks to the rich functionality and advanced technology, our U.S. team is doing great job lending and expanding our businesses and moving up market.\\nOur investment in R&D help us maintain the leadership position of our product portfolio. In the second quarter, we made upgrades to a key component in our product offering. For example, our Life CoreSuite new release is using cloud-native architecture. It includes reconfigure products and processes that accelerate new insurance product launches. New version of our cloud-based digital suites for both P&C and Life and Annuities. And we have released a new version of our cloud-based insurance underwriting solution with a new insurance interface.\\nIn terms of service [Technical Issue] we see an increased demand for managed services across all of our products and regions. Our managed services offerings brought tremendous value to our customer during the COVID-19. These platforms allowed customers to focus on their businesses, while we take care of the technology operational part. We continue to expand our ecosystem to support our customers with the latest insurtech and digital [Technical Issue]\\nIn driven by growth in North America and EMEA.

If the insurance start to ask any other line of business, what we call multi-line, Delphi has a lot of challenges. And this is why we start to win deals, [Indecipherable] start to win deals and the One Shield. We don't really see a lot of Guidewire in this area.\\nSo those are the main competitors. We also won few deals in the past. Right now because we have -- already have med mal customer together with all the knowledge and the knowhow for Delphi, the combination of two of them, we definitely will continue to lead this market. We have close to 40 customers, it's many and a lot of knowledge and for many, many years, a very good track record. The main challenge was the technology and to support the multi-line.\\nBhavan Suri -- William Blair -- Analyst\\nGot it. Got it. And then maybe one last one. Obviously the rev raise for the full year is less than even half of Delphi's revenue. And so just help me understand sort of the conservative future building into the core business, the organic part of the business? Sort of how you're guys thinking about that growth? And sort of -- kind of are you expecting that there are some challenges or slowdown of business or is it just [Indecipherable] Just trying to understand sort of what you've built in there for the full year given that the raise with sort of Delphi's rev norm?\\nRoni Giladi -- Chief Financial Officer\\nHi, Bhavan. This is Roni G. So if you remember, by the end of Q1 of 2020, we reduced our guidance by 2%. The acquisition of Delphi is on a full year basis supposed to be about $6 million. So the increase in the revenue is mainly coming from Delphi. We do not expect right now organically to grow Sapiens stand-alone basis. So the incremental is coming only from Delphi on this revenue.\\nBhavan Suri -- William Blair -- Analyst\\nGot it. Got it. If I might squeeze one last one, I'm sorry. What drove the upside in gross margin? Like what -- how does your gross margin [Indecipherable]? Thank you.\\nRoni Giladi -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. All the factors that I mentioned in my prepared remarks are basically inputs in operational expenses and gross margin. For example, at the time of that we asked employees to use across the entire company, the freeze in recruiting, this is another factor was the gross margin up by 1% compared to previous quarter. Going forward further in Q3 and Q4, we do not expect all these things will happen. As I mentioned earlier, we are right now in recruiting mode. We have open position of almost 200 employees. To support our growth, we are not implementing any use of vacation days. So the gross margin will not be as it in Q2, but we expect that it will be probably in the mid-range, 45.5 something like that.\\nBhavan Suri -- William Blair -- Analyst\\nGot you. Thank you, guys. I appreciate it. Nice job.\\nRoni Al-Dor -- President & Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you.\\nOperator\\nThe next question is from Tavy Rosner of Barclays.
